# Getting started if you're a DL fool

# Front end
This [blog](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) is super helpful!

# Environment stuff
Create a new environment using this, run the command from root directory
```
python -m venv venv
```
(you better be using python 3 tho. And this name is important bc the gitignore ignores this folder name)

Then activate the venv. This depends on what you're running, but likely you're in windows so just do this
```
source venv/Scripts/activate
```
(it might be in venv/bin/activate if you're cool and on linux or something idk)
