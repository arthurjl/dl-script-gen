cute oh my god this is when Francine was born look how little but look it says poo Candace's last name is pool pol and we didn't name her for a couple days so her name in the hospital was poo they only allowed three letters P Oh Oh poo alright why am i showing you all this footage from when the baby was born this was last December and of course when Francine was born that was the most important thing happening in my entire life at the moment on today's vlog I want to talk about the second most important thing that was happening in my life at the exact same time Frannie was born the only thing in life that stands between you and everything you've ever wanted to do is doing it on today's blog being a history lesson a super short history about how beam came to be I love social media I owe like so much of my career to social media I use every social media platform out there but I've always had like my own ideas about what is needed in social media and about a year and a half ago sharing those ideas with like a mentor of mine I was encouraged he encouraged me I realized then that all that stood between me and everything I've ever wanted to do in life was doing it and that's when I decided to start being um the first thing I did was I needed money so I went around and and asked everybody that I could think of that might give me money for money and I got a small amount of money I wanted to start a technology company but I'm not a technologist I don't know how to do these things so I set out on this mission to figure out how and eventually I met Matt Matt is my business partner knot is a visionary Matt knows technology Matt ran engineering at tumblr from when they were this big until they're the Tumblr you know today this guy knows how to make things happen Andy's a visionary shares these he shares the big picture with me all right Matt tell me why bean it's the first thing since I left tumblr that felt like it could be that big that millions of people would actually get love and get obsessed with in the same way for like six months it was just the two of us trying to figure out what beam is how to do this like big ambitious idea that we have how do we realize this and at the end of those six months we built like it brought an app it just sort of looks like an app on your phone and that's when we needed more money and this workout really scary like really scary have you ever asked anybody for money the last time I asked someone for money was like freshman year in high school asking my dad for extra lunch money so I could buy a dumb feed after class asking for money is scary and we needed a lot of money so I leaned out all the influential people I know to set me up with meetings with the kinds of people that can write big fat checks for entrepreneurs like me that want to start a company they're called venture capitalists now I'm going to look up on Wikipedia what a venture capitalist is so I can explain it to you is financial capital provided to early-stage high potential growth startup companies just getting a meeting with these VCS was tricky then you have to sit down in front of them and you have to tell them your idea and then you ask them for an insane amount of money it's a little bit like going up to like the best looking person in your entire high school and asking them to prom and invariably they're going to say no I'm not going to go to prom with you some of them said why don't you go to prom alone this year and if your prom king I'll go with you next year but most of them just said no and when someone says no to you it like it rattles your confidence it really like gets into your head and we were doing meeting after meeting after meeting after meeting and while all of this was taking place Candice was nine months pregnant in Houston Texas she was like ready to pop then on our second trip out there finally got like some actual like tangible interest people that that wanted to invest or sort of wanted to invest that morning 7 a.m. Candace calls me nothing's hurting badly yet so coming up check it this is like two weeks early the doctor gave us assurances there was no chance she was gonna go into labor I just hope she waits for me NAT and I are racing to the airport we had to cancel all of our important venture capitalist meetings I flew to Texas we had the baby everything was perfect here's a great little video I made about going to have the baby but the deal didn't close and Candace and I were in the hospital with Francine when she was born for five days and I never left the hospital for those five days I stayed with her but I commandeered the nurses break room which was right next to Candace's hospital room and I literally spend every moment that Candace was asleep in that nurses room with this notepad on my phone like this trying to make the deal happen and in the end Francine was perfectly healthy and we left the hospital with our lovely new beautiful healthy baby girl and in the end Matt and I closed on over two million dollars in funding for beam get headed home now you're responsible if I can't answer a cancer I did hey are we going out to dinner yeah I don't know are you gonna put clothes on or you just gonna wear your underwear Candice was completely naked when I came home in her when I asked her why she said she was hot we have an air conditioner you just turned it on I was fully clothed in that department hi baby girl who's outside they're having so much fun in the Sun okay Candice and I are out having dinner I just realized I didn't do Q&amp;A today I'm sorry which question Haley asks how do you find time to vlog and run a business I don't sleep can you do a wheelie on your bicycle or Vespa bicycle yes Vespa no better question I'm a 17 year old filmmaker how do

YouTube do a million and a half views I think a millions a safe number million a half's like a good ball hey that's that's that's crazy what do you attribute it to because I know my audience cares about this stuff does a lot of aspiring new youtubers watch this channel I would say for me it's the consistency's huge kisses he's huge and also you know III motivate my viewers and I believe in positive energies and I've copied everything you've ever done so it's made me the bigger youtuber no I will say if I get a million views on vlogs you're gonna it's safe to know that you're gonna be pulling two mil on a blog soon you started with prank videos yeah yeah well sketch comedy I failed miserably I started with sketch for a year and it didn't work nice I was terrible my they're still on my channel they're embarrassing I should probably delete really sure and your background comedy film making do you have any background in the industry nothing completely self-taught in fact a factory worker for 12 years and how long have even YouTube in I think five years successfully knows maybe times line six years maybe six years that's the samurai alright one piece of advice for young people that want to get into the YouTube game man this is a tough one huh if I always push originality be original there's no reason to be the next guy he's already doing it be you like that's the best advice I can think of we get definitely nicer rolling outward making friends in Walmart you don't need the suitcase all right take care now well that went well no give Casey a little launch in the GTR

p.m. cheers a long day today was like called a funeral crying family all that stuff I was really looking forward to pulling aside like 45 minutes to do a QA not sure to be able to do that and we're flying out tomorrow 5:00 a.m. so it should be up at 3:00 a.m. it's not like super fun stuff happening right now on the blog Hey look there's Candace all set thank you so much take care now how was your day that was your day good yeah did you miss us what do you see you missed us so much okay I'm sitting out here alone by the pool at the st. Regis Hotel in Houston Texas it is like a thousand degrees out here whatever let's get this started since the reason why I'm here at like a patio at a hotel in Houston Texas is because we're in town for a funeral I thought I would make this whole Q&amp;A around the theme of family okay Scott Talbot asks are there any films you've made specifically for your family yeah when my dad got cancer like ten years ago I made a movie for him about us kids his kids and I used the metaphor the analogy of like he was a b-52 bomber and we were little atomic bombs that he dropped on the world that was a really personal film that I made just for my dad Alissa asks how do you think Francine will react to watching your vlogs when she's older I don't know but all of the footage of me from when I was a baby is like around a holiday or birthday or like opening a present or some sort of event and what I would love is to see what I was like when I was a baby or when I was a kid just like living my normal life so if I were Francine I would love it but who knows oh okay Garrett asks another kid if having kids didn't require the whole pregnancy thing I would have like 50 of them but I honestly don't know if my marriage to Candace could survive another pregnancy so the answer to the question about whether or not to have more kids is a big fat question mark Ben Porter who is the most inspirational member of your family to me um my Nana she died a couple years ago but my grandmother was my hero I made a movie about her I'll link it here but she she was a tap dancer she entertained the troops during World War two she found her passion in life to dance and she did it literally until the day before she died when she was 92 she is just like to me she embodies everything that I've ever sought after in life which is finding what makes you happy and literally doing it every single day whose Owens real mother what like he has a fake mother Owens real mother is Robin she's with Owen right now in Arizona looking at colleges Alberto does it damage you to spend so much time working far from your family I think what you're asking is like is it bad for the family that I work so much I don't know it's a trade-off in life for me probably because I was so poor when I had Owen providing for my family is my number one priority which means that like spending time with my family comes second to my ability to provide for them and what that means that rather spend less time with them and know that they have a safe home and all their needs are fulfilled then it does for me to be with them all day long but us to struggle and me to not you know have the confidence to know that I'm going to be able to put a roof over their head and pay for food and I know those sound like extremes cuz I live a very comfortable life and I still work really hard but it's like a concern and a fear I I can't shake because when you know what it means to be hungry and when you know what it means to not be able to provide for your kids it pushes you really hard to want to make sure that that they're safe their whole lives Douglas asks what's the craziest experience you've had with Candice around the world okay there are a whole bunch one time I was doing like a big art show in Paris and I stayed in this absurdly expensive hotel that Sony paid for because they sponsored the event and the hotel was so dim like you literally couldn't see your way around the hotel it's called the hotel cost look it up and one night we came back and she was really pissed off about how dark it was in the hotel and she took a towel and she smashed out every light bulb in the elevator and then in the hallway of the hotel so it was literally pitch black she was a total troublemaker when she was younger I don't know if that's the craziest but that's like the only one I can think of okay that's it for today's Q&amp;A I'm glad I was able to get it in because I wasn't sure I was gonna do a vlog at all today and Q&amp;A is one of my favorite things to do on this vlog it's one of the times I really get to interact with the audience and they're like a very literal way there's a man so many cigarettes over here who watch this whole thing physically hey doing me talking to just the camera okay that's it for today's vlog you got a lot of fans on the internet you got a lot of fans I owe you I do owe you Marlon someone interesting is meeting me at my office this morning I don't know him never met him before but this is his legacy ready he took the most liked picture in the history of Instagram that's kind of amazing 2.5 million likes you took this photo I did I did exactly exactly a year ago today is that right yeah yeah I guess so yeah take how do you be in a position to take the most liked Instagram photo honestly I have no idea it just happened I got asked the day before the wedding do you know uh Kim and Kanye never met them before that before were they happy with your pitarrio day yet they're very happy and I spoke to Kim after a few weeks after and she was very very happy how has it impacted your career a lot I'm now the guy that took the most like forever on Instagram so people know who I am now in the industry and still fit got my name out there my cameras are all charged all ready to go as it wasn't and I was out the door hey Greta yeah oh yeah papi could I see yeah oh yeah looks great there's a bunch of it awesome man thanks for being fast you are you're good Connor so good to meet you you too thanks for coming by yeah I hope to see you soon little dick look like weed out here fellas too long smile dude Steve idols I believe have fun with Calvin Harris will there see laughs see you later one of my favorite things about what I do for a living is that I always get to meet interesting new people oh Jesus you wanna try and ride it down the hallway sure it looks dangerous it's very dangerous all right good luck going you can do it before that even I don't think that's your problem okay just a full disclosure Conor the photographer and Owen on the unicycle that that happened yesterday but I couldn't fit it in yesterday as long so I thought I'd put in today's vlog but since today's vlog doesn't play until tomorrow anyways does it matter that yesterday's content is in today for tomorrow's vlog I can't keep track of this stuff all right which which of these lenses is preferable this one or where's this lens better like that's a little bit go with the other one okay pretty usual every Tuesday afternoon is Q&amp;A time where you guys tweet me questions post questions below email questions whatever and I try to answer them here we go Connor wants to know can you imagine living working somewhere that isn't New York in the future totally Candace and I talked a lot about moving to Los Angeles I think I've mentioned that in this vlog before maybe not Tilman wants to know what was your first camera and when did you get it hold tight gentlemen this was my first video camera that's what it looks like it's broken in every which way it was like $1,700 and it was so expensive I couldn't pay for it with one credit card I had to use multiple credit cards all of which I maxed out to buy this thing Nina question from my dad who's a new fan welcome Nina's dad what has been your biggest failure ah Nina's dad I made a whole vlog called my biggest failure here I'll link it for you right here save me a whole bunch of Lin asks what's your opinion on bullying when I don't know that people can have an opinion on bullying people are either unequivocally against bullying or people are wrong I loathe bullying I can't stand bullying hurt people hurt people as and if someone is hurt then they'd make it their mission to hurt other people and that's who bullies are when someone bullies me by saying something malicious in the comments or wherever I just block them from this YouTube channel I want them out of my life and I think that's that's kind of an analogy for life in general if someone is negative if someone is a bully to stay as far away from them as possible and something that my big brother van used to say which is really true and really harsh their life is their punishment if someone is really negative believe me when I say they'll have horrible life ahead of them and that horrible life is their punishment for being such a negative hurtful person how would you feel if Owen got a girl pregnant that's a weird question Elizabeth wants to know are you a Taylor Swift fan of course I'm a Taylor Swift fan what kind of a monster isn't a Taylor Swift fan Aiden asks if you go back in time what advice would you give your 20 year old self don't listen to anyone that's what I'd tell myself do you think it's better to plan out your future all the way through or just play it by ear and see what happens I apologize if I've said this in the vlog before I can't remember and this also isn't my original idea someone else told this to me but it's great it was a great piece of advice that I'm happy to share I believe in something called the Tarzan method and what that means is you are Tarzan me Tarzan starting on this side of the jungle your goals your dreams your aspirations they're the other side of the jungle and there's no straight line through the jungle you know let me do an animation point here the Tarzan method what that means is your Tarzan your fear and you want to get the other side of the jungle here ideally there's this straight line but when you find in life what I found in life this is non-existent this straight line here is a unicorn it doesn't exist instead you reach and you grab on to whatever the vine you can grab on to and you swing and that vine might carry you in this direction which doesn't feel like the right direction of your goal but it does get you a little bit closer and then you grab onto another vine it swings you all the way over here a little bit closer and then you swing in this direction and in this direction in this direction in this direction in this direction in this direction and eventually you make it to where you want to be but the beauty of the Tarzan method the ton of the magic of being open-minded in your pursuit is that like these unknowns like where it might take you that you didn't imagine that's usually where you find something that is actually what your goals are I don't believe that there is a straight line between where you are and where you want to be in life ever not with family not with romantic interest and especially not your career so an open-mindedness even if it looks like this will yield results and outcomes that otherwise would have been unforeseeable okay I'm ending the Q&amp;A Derrick's 2,000 degrees in this office because the air conditioning because the air conditioners broken Candace just texted me she's only had her nails done this evening so dad's in charge of baby bath and putting the baby to bed I love these nights how was vacation very nice very nice best man Marlin don't move hold on I got something for you pull out Marlin don't leave ah you guys are crazy me thank you very much wait it wasn't us in fact thank you guys let me know when it's all set up we'll get count bean got to man today's August 25th which means summer's over like 15 minutes or something I'm starting to get PSP that is post summer panic I need to spend more time outside if I'm going to do this outside I need to find the perfect spot which is a lot harder than you think I'm thinking the West Side Highway is probably the best because it's really pretty there and it's like noon on a Tuesday so their problem won't be a lot of people see I definitely couldn't do it around here that's what I'm thinking over there probably do it here I want to do it out there all right this is good I'm gonna do it Jays Q&amp;A is a themed Q&amp;A I told everyone to ask me questions about making Internet videos yesterday's vlog was about YouTube and Internet filmmaking and people had a lot of like feedback in the comments so today's QA just about making Internet videos first question is from Garrett what will you do when YouTube dies I'll improvise it was like when silent films died there were talkies when talkies died there was television television turned into cable cable turned into like Netflix the distribution medium the genres will always shift and creators the people were making the content will always shift with it somewhat ironically my HBO show was literally exactly like this vlog and it failed miserably on television but does really well on YouTube all right Cass asks how do you choose the title for your vlogs that's simple I come up with the most clickbait like title I can possibly come up with so I just want you guys to click on it and then if you think it's boring just stop watching but I try to come up with the most enticing titles possible even if they're completely inaccurate sorry about that I'm going to turn this this way William asks what do you dislike most about Internet videos because you get rewarded for the more views you have online there's a real opportunity to sort of duke the system by putting out exploitive content that you know people are going to click on but I don't think that's unique to Internet video if you look at television there are TV shows like TMZ which is both negative and exploitive by definition but people watch that I think it's it's human nature to always turn your head and look at a car accident but that doesn't mean a car accidents a good thing just because people want to look at it Jack asks do you ever get self-conscious posting videos no Joe asks what's your opinion on doing YouTube for money here's the thing because YouTube is so accessible I think there's this misconception that it's easier to succeed on YouTube than it is to succeed in mainstream media that is not true if anything it's harder on YouTube you're competing with a billion other creators it's really hard to stand out it's really hard to carve your place and it's especially hard to make money tell you like float the top so you're doing better than everyone else say you're garnering something like a hundred thousand views a day a hundred thousand views a day will make you let me do some math will make you about thirty thousand dollars a year which is roughly the same as you'd make getting a job that's just above minimum wage if you succeed on YouTube to the degree of a hundred thousand views a day seven days a week 365 days a year you'll probably make about as much money as I did when I was washing dishes and doing prep cook work so yes you can make money on YouTube it's not easy it is an incredibly incredibly difficult thing to do that of all the creators on YouTube there's just a couple at the top that have actually been able to make enough money to make a life for themselves ah this is a nice dovetail for my previous question what advice would you give someone thinking about starting a daily vlog one piece of advice make sure you're doing it for the right reasons those reasons can pretty much be anything but I want to be famous I want to be rich maybe you want to have a documentation of your life maybe you're compelled to share your own ideas or perspectives maybe you want to get better at filmmaking and doing something every day will get you to that place those are all great reasons wanting to be like the next YouTube superstar I think is a really bad reason I'm going to turn around again because all I can hear is this like terrible music Julia asks why did you start moviemaking well Julia I started making movies when I was literally living in a trailer park I was 19 years old 18 years old 19 years old something like that I had some free time so I would spend all of my days at home watching my baby son when I first edited video on like a crappy old iMac computer I was just so excited that all of my ideas in my head I could actually turn into something and that something was a little video and honestly like that seed of an idea that really primitive early motivation is the exact reason why I create movies now alright that's it for this week's Q&amp;A I've gotta get back to work just do a quick Joyride before I do it's so nice out so I was just doing like buck 90 on my electric skateboard that's there and my SLR fell off of this piece of and smashed on the ground there's one piece there one piece there there there and there great that's busted man can't tell if the

I don't check my mail here often but I just did and I've got a parking ticket from Tel Aviv from Israel for $28 how did they possibly track me down for $28 and yesterday's vlog I mentioned how long these edits take me to do and there are a bunch of comments that were like why don't you just have an intern edit it for you or why don't you have someone else do the edits editing is the difference between a pile of paint you bought in the store and a finished Picasso the Edit is the difference between a pile of paper and a pencil and the iliad a pile of instruments and the Beatles there's nothing mechanical about editing the Edit is where the story is told the Edit is where the movie is crafted the Edit is what matters more than anything else it's pretty early but it's pouring rain out this morning in Boston so I'm going to go check out the hotel cam all right I feel like that is enough working out I had to leave like I have to jump in this pool right that's 11:30 in the morning I wonder how it is away well look who's in there how much longer are you gonna be down here because we got to leave now not now I'm gonna take a shower and pack and stuff but like in the next half an hour goodbye Boston we are a leaving Cambridge Boston area now on our way to worry young Vatican or New York City I don't wait I get what this is strapless what are you talking at say hi to you are you doing father-son lunch at a highway rest stop here's the thing about fast food in general the first bite is always delicious the next bite is slightly less delicious and then that trajectory continues until you're towards the end and each bite is just I am falling asleep at the wheel so get out of the kid drive I'm falling asleep don't crash we went by Owens mother's house to pick up his car which I am now driving because Owens far is much nicer than my car how's the ride good I like what today is all about productivity have been neglecting my house in my yard for many months and today I will rectify that situation this place is going to look great for springtime I got this thing a couple years ago I never use it it's awesome it's been sitting for a while so put a little oil in it cause there's oil in it it's fine truly great scooter a lot of fun goes really fast - we're going to the burger place thank you Sam another photo what else do you want the eel oh yeah that's right this here really good we're gonna do eight burgers but we got sushi instead I think it's the right decision don't you just getting home it's late at nine o'clock that is so late for me you pick either I have the wrong day or the wrong address this doesn't look right at all I have an interesting morning this morning that is Washington Square Park riding your bike through here is punishable by like 150 dollars fine which I agree with I'm already late I don't wanna have to ride around the entire park so just saw this I was like dude okay maybe you've seen that crazy amazing series on HBO called the jinx this guy edited the whole thing he had a much bigger role than that but this is the genius behind that I think this is where I'm going I hope you're having a good day so far mine sucks I like didn't run this morning and got up early I mean I always get up early but I left the house early to race to this event that I agreed to do and I got to it just now and the event is until tomorrow so there's nobody to blame for my so far today that doesn't make it any less now I'm sure this wasn't done on purpose but if I had an angle grinder right now I cut this bike in half this is my bike yeah this is some bike and this dip locked his lock through my brake cable so I can't get my bike free because this put his lock through my cable ah I'm gonna undo my whole cable to free it without breaking the bike but like this is my brake cable here disconnected from the lever pulled it out from the lock now I have to reconnect it so far today I've complained about screwing up my own schedule and I've complained about somebody locking my bike up I don't understand why people complain it only seems right for me to dedicate this entire blog to complaining thus begins the complaining blog let's chat a little about complainers generally a complaint is a person who doesn't take responsibility for their own action a complainer is someone who would always talk about why they failed instead of how to succeed now there's one simple reason why it's never ever okay to complain and that is there's always someone that has it worse than you do let me give that a little context so when I think about some of the things in my life that I'd want to complain about some of the really hard things and then I give them any sort of real world context they aren't that consequential let me get really specific when I was 16 years old and I had to drop out of high school to get a terrible job to support my new baby that's pretty rough you know that is a big enough excuse for me to justify any actions I take in my life I know but I couldn't do this because to embrace that as an excuse to complain but the truth is that's not so bad dropping out of high school like really not having much of a place to live having no money having a baby being on welfare like all those things really suck but in the grand scheme of humanity it's not that bad bear with me I turn on my computer I go to a news site and the first story I read is about migrants from Myanmar that are stuck on a boat stranded because the Thai government won't let them into port these are people just like you and me and they're literally starving to death and this is right now I don't mean to be so extreme but these are the things that I remind myself of any time I want to complain or  about something in my life you about something in my life you realize that there are people just like you and me who at this very moment are truly facing things we are lucky enough to go our entire lives without ever having to experience okay let me tell let me tell one more story to back this up one more story we're like my feelings around complaining and life in general were really set straight three years ago I did this project led like a very small relief mission to the Philippines after they had been devastated by Typhoon Haiyan this is some of the video here somebody's home people didn't have water people didn't have food you know these people had nothing their livelihood their life their existence had totally been stripped away from them and what struck me the most about the entire experience all of my time there was not once did anyone complain but they had lost everything and they didn't complain and they all focused on one thing they focused on change not complaining and because that I do take it personally when people complain because the truth is most of the time people who complain have nothing to complain about who cares if I went to a meeting that doesn't start till tomorrow and who cares if some guy locked up bye-bye brake cable it really doesn't matter broken fix it if you don't like it change it and if you want something take it don't complain about it just do something about it and is taking Francine to the baby gym and I'm hoping to catch them and go for a second how was your day did you take a nap today did you sleep today this is the baby gym let me say Francine do you think she likes it it is funny I have to run back the office now to catch up before I cut out for the day so I love Candice and baby I have the baby gym getting their workout on start out now definitely glad i saw

the other ways what else what a frat boy say I'd always rather be outside but when you can't be outside yet improvise I use the stairs headed home now Candace had an appointment and I'm home alone with the baby and I gave her her first Oreo if it's delicious it's delicious I know they're my favorite too don't tell mommy they're a little bit I know Oreos are so good so good she's eating a mango

to do I'm with that ladies and gentlemen ease put your hands together for our fantastic Hawaiian Airlines terminators who loves to play peek-a-boo alright let's go home I'm gonna go through up and talk to my camera from the notepad I'll be right back this is a baby show why are you so into it I'll be right back I'll be right back at Kemah tsa's enthusiastic recommendation today was kind of a nothing day as in spend as much time resting and being with the baby and doing nothing as possible and it was great it's a nice juxtaposition to what is my normal day which is fighting to find a few minutes here there to spend with the baby and sleeping for hours life like my life I think life goes in peaks and valleys of like I guess like Sprint's and then when you slow down a little bit and the word Sprint's particularly accurate here because at the new company we're constantly doing these like these tech Sprint's you make a list of things you need to get done and you just don't stop the sprint until they're all done and I feel like my life has been in one of those Sprint's for like I guess the last two years which is like marriage baby new company and it means I haven't really slept in the last couple years like these dark circles these never go away they're always there and I know that there will be a valley eventually where I get to calm down and take a break the concern for me is what will I do when I get the next Valley it's it's the slowing down that scares me never the sprint okay I just came up here to record that monologue this fog is so crazy I'm going to do one quick time-lapse this crazy card only had three wheels three wheels on that car three wheels whoa water No ready baby's asleep Candace's mom is there watching her for the next couple of hours Candice is still away her mother's here to help me for for the rest of the night right now I'm sneaking across town to go grab the car there's my car thank you my man good good thank you on top of paying like

locations with amazing views of the city and shoot like as many as I can in an afternoon I've been here shooting on the West Side Highway for the last like 40 minutes I'm gonna move now because I feel like all the shots on getting here are starting to look the same I try to do these little time-lapse adventures like once a week you're on your bike chasing the Sun around the city looking for pretty things bye guys see you later I really wanted to be home by like 8 o'clock tonight to get started on this edit it's now 9:45 and I'm only now just on my way home so it's gonna be a late night it's 6:00 in the morning listen to what it sounds like outside of my bedroom window [Music] this has been going on for an hour [Music] so on today's vlog I want to tell a story and I want to tell a story for a couple reasons the main reason being that I'm not doing anything interesting today or vlog worthy so I need something to fill up the next five minutes but also this is a story I've never told before those are all my old photo albums up there so this story happened in I want to say 1990 let's see I was like fifteen years old 1997 I couldn't find my 1997 photo album all I could find was this one this is my mom's photo album from 1996 but it will help sort of show you what I looked like before this story that's me Disney World with my Nana and my little brother okay that's me surfing in Maine ah that is me that's my big brother van that's us riding unicycles these are non motorized unicycles as I get towards kind of the end of this album there are no pictures of me because this was when I ran away from home and that's what my story's about I made a movie called draw my life that's like the whole biography my whole biography it's a really great movie I'm super proud of it but there's a whole scene in it that we didn't use because the movie was too long so I want to use a piece I'm gonna use that scene for this story here's what happened first a tiny bit of context I was 15 years old I had gotten in a fight with my mom I got into a bunch of trouble at school I ran away from home I moved from Connecticut to Virginia where my brother van was in college and I like got a job there now I wanted to go to school there I wanted to go to high school I was in tenth grade I was my sophomore year of high school but in order to be in high school you have to be a resident of the state of Virginia in order for me to be a resident my legal guardian had to also live in the state the only person of legal age then was my brother Van I was 15 he was 21 the only option we had was for him to adopt me we scheduled a day in court in Van and I had to go literally in front of a judge like I don't like Judge Judy or whatever and we had to petition we deplete our case now to set the stage a little bit more we were both wearing suits that we had bought at the Salvation Army for like $5 the day before but definitely didn't fit us on top of that about a week prior we thought it was a smart idea for us to bleach our hair so we both had like really obnoxiously white hair and we're wearing cheap suits from the Salvation Army see Virginia that's me that's my brother van and this this is us in court and that's the judge I just fixed my white balance if all the shots before this were Orange I'm sorry I fixed it though so we pleaded our case to the judge which was like a pretty honest which was a pretty honest case but I think the fact that the only reason why we were trying to do this was so I could go to school was something that she took pity on a little bit she empathize with so I just I just remember her saying vividly against my better instincts I will grant this and just like that my brother van my 21 year old brother van adopted me and he was my legal guardian immediately after she like granted us the guardianship or whatever we left the courtroom as we were supposed to do and we went outside and this was when I was like you know I was just like a confused kid so I was still smoking cigarettes then and we went outside and van was like lighting my cigarette and just as he was lighting my cigarette the judge walks out of her chambers or whatever and I just remember her like looking over at us making eye contact as I'm like and my new legal guardian is like and she looks us and shakes her head and that that's what's going on that's exactly what's going on here this is a judge that's my big brother that's me he's letting my cigarette as we're on our way to the car and she's just like what have I done that was sort of the story of my teenage years so that's it that's the whole story that I wanted to share the epilogue to that was after all of our effort and ban adopting me I then got my girlfriend pregnant and we had to move back to Connecticut and I never got to finish high school but for that moment there was like six months of my life where my big brother van was my like adopted parent okay hope you like that story [Music] this is what your this is what New York City sounds like [Music] I I fell off my bicycle this morning I was like doing a tight turn and there was an apex of peak in the pavement my pedal was at its lowest I was leaning the bike the pedal hit the pavement light came out from under me okay watch right here right watch that again see and then this woman is here it's not a big deal there's just like this woman came running over and asked if I was okay and just kind of name was feel like a dope Sonia Saracen anyways I have a pretty early business meeting this morning okay I like this I like to schedule meetings early in the morning when someone pushes back and if I don't want to eat that early it's probably somebody you don't want to be working with today is a bike day there really is no point in complaining about the weather that said this weather is total it's the second week of April and it's 33 degrees out right now I go on and on about how much I love New York City what do I not love about New York City by connectivity a little bit more like Los Angeles just like this much more Sun and this much less whatever you call this great bush this is not a safe way to lock your bicycle but I'm eating right there so it should be okay [Music] today's the day of meetings that was the breakfast meeting then I'm lunch meeting chu afternoon meetings and then a late-night meeting hall meetings all day a rolling paper company designed this skateboard yeah but it's like a pretty solid skateboard considering and you just were like you know what this office needs is a weed escapable I think that's what we need is a weed skateboard I will say this is not I will say this space is amazing for scape back ok next meeting of the day is a brief lunch meeting there's going to be a deeper lunch meeting but we're gonna take outruns meeting with mr. Finn Harries all right you really get on camera and you should think about starting a YouTube channel why are we eating today the same place I ate yesterday and pretty much every day walk over I did all the proof if you've been following chase nice ass plots like I have the last two weeks you'll join me in applauding him for creating such well produced high-quality narrative content I hope we have more people like you will need you how much dude thank you for coming by it was a pleasure to see you you know how to get out of here yeah I got up there you did get up here later Finn thanks for coming by there's there's a critical mass that your brain hits where when you've been doing so many things at once it's thinking about so many things at the same time it just kind of seizes up and your ability to process new information fails I hit that point today it's okay though okay p.m. a new day starts for hours [Music] so love to hear what you think of my new haircut let me know in the comments below all negative comments will be deleted you'll be blocked from the channel and I'll report you to YouTube for hate speech I was a really terrible student when I when I was in school and I could never focus I've never cared enough but anything I was doing to do it well and when I was a kid I just assumed I was an idiot because that's what my teachers told me but later in life when I found something that I really was passionate about something I really cared about I had laser focus and did it to the absolute best of my ability and was relentless until I was really really good at it so I don't the takeaway is there but super lovely morning in Cambridge gonna go for a quick Cambridge to Boston back to Cambridge run you all right that's a super short run running very late this morning four miles at a 717 pace I left the kid alone in there we're already late for the day so calling it there in case there was any doubt as to whether or not Owen is actually my son he was at the gym last night till about 11:00 he's at the gym in the morning that's my boy we are headed into the lab now we're running late my hair is very short do you like my haircut Owen yeah are you just saying that I really want to get into what it is I've been doing here at MIT I'm excited to talk about that today so I was originally invited here in late 2013 and I started here in 2014 working with the social computing group the social computing group creates socio-technical they create processes and systems and software's that affects the real world the physical world that we live in and this group is made up of computer scientists and architects and fine artists and people from all kinds of different disciplines they approached me as a filmmaker to come sort of blend my skillset to the group now the project I worked on the one that I found most fulfilling was a school system that this group started called wildflower Montessori which is an early education school system so it's young kids preschool age and they are essentially really tiny schools that are in like storefronts that you would see in like a mini mall why have one gigantic school that everyone has to travel to why not just have a bunch of smaller schools that are hyper local so this is probably my favorite thing that I did and this series that you're watching here it was it was a real collaboration and a super fulfilling project to be a part of so that suggests that the majority of my time here was spent making movies in contributing other ways to projects that the social computing team was working on this is left out one of the aspects of my work that I am most proud of being a part of this team and this lab all right taking it off now I get home doubt you'll find Owen by Kim idea oh and I are going to the movies this evening we're going to see Fast &amp; Furious 7 or whatever the hell is beautiful Boston Common I'm not telling you girl hi yeah that's me thank you sir have a good night we are going to the movies oh I hope that lines not for us one Canyon one ice cream do you think it's give me enough for you on what did you think I haven't seen those music like 30% to 70% come on it was like the best movie ever he could have used a little bit more of the rock but besides that right move it where are you taking us holding the upper sounds I find the best teams in here I want always finds the most creative ways to get out of movie theatres you wear well look what were you doing at the gym until midnight this edit you have no idea how much time these edits take you really really dark here I hope my light-up belt is enough kind of anxious about today today's Thursday tomorrow Friday I'm leaving town from what's going to be like a week and a half or something I'm going to Mexico City tomorrow I'll be speaking at the off festival that's Oh F F F Festival in Mexico City on Saturday I think so if you're in Mexico City definitely come say hi but then I'm going to LA and then I'm going to San Francisco and then somewhere else so everything's like crammed into today the thing about these kinds of days is that it's just back to back to back meetings and phone calls and email and stuff so I can be situated for when I leave town not a particularly exciting day my little brother my little brother just texted me he's apparently he's outside right now hey DC guy out there it looks just like me yo what's new Dean anything new no well then it was good to see you how's that little brother we did talk about stuff I just didn't put that in the vlog I don't want you to think that he just came and I said what's up and then he took off okay this is one bright spot and otherwise like really abysmal day tomorrow I fly to Mexico City I didn't want to leave my electro scape were behind so I called this company in Texas that makes like a boosted board bag and they overnighted me this thing oh yeah ready for the airport all right let me leave that behind many many many months ago here in the vlog I introduced you to my friend Oscar he's the guy that I need the McDonald's video with Oscar made this totally doped video that I produced I helped him with it and he finished it like six months ago but then he just released it today how's the video doing online pretty good this crazy office is Oscar studio it's a good spots what do you do up there in the loft Oscar sometimes we shoot sometimes we watch movies it's sort of the storage space right now all-purpose like give me a preview of your new movie the Los Angeles to make a music video I went to the car I didn't with a friend went location scout try the hold a camera with gassing out the car at the same time Thursday carry on casting founder Pharma shootout milky boat rented lengthy camera trucks wardrobe cross pop food

wearing a funny outfit is my sweater on over my GC hi puppy Oh are you eating grapes I eat little baby great the biggest bummer about going on this trip for like 11 days or whatever is going to be not seeing Candice and not seeing Francine and not seeing Owen I hate that heading home now got the boosted board can I drop my stuff off give the baby a bath and then we're doing a little company party tonight for bean I got to go catch up with the bean squad till see you guys in an hour bye girls bye fanny hey cuz I headed to meet the squad now they are at Chelsea Piers I think they're bowling I'm gonna stop by ooh I'm gonna stop by the Apple store first I just want to see what the lines look like for the iPhone which comes out tomorrow morning so last last year for the iPhone 6 launch I made a movie about how the iPhones were sold primarily on the Chinese gray market and what that means they were bought here in the States and then sold in China and I got a lot of trouble for the video because people said it was racist because it was mostly Chinese people in the line race had nothing to do with it it's just that the market for these things was in China so most of the people waiting in line happened to be Chinese it's like if the if there was a market for in New Jersey everyone in line would be from New Jersey and this is the iPhone line situation in New York City it's an amazing phenomenon it started already where what would you call it exporters of the good pay these people sit there last year there was crazy with the fights at broke everything it's such an interesting phenomenon that waiting outside to buy then resell the phones I don't blame those people if you need money and they're getting paid to wait in line like why not do it I also don't really understand why Apple doesn't just end cash sales it's the bowling alleys in here somewhere actually I have no idea where I'm going we want to find the bowling alley thank you yes it's my fried food sorry I'm late guys we're getting out of control that I didn't actually drink any that was it just for show hey my name is Josh you one know what life is like part-time lumberjack musician or whatever else I may be doing only on Dean Kansas underscore Josh fine I'll see you later have fun at work baby's asleep I'm gonna try to sneak in a quick run hi buddy hello there hi big guy you want to say hi bye bye that was the biggest dog I've ever seen that was 11.6 miles at a 751 pace it is hot you okay in there Francine and I are now headed to the beach you want to go are you doing let me see your flip that's it for today maybe I'll jump a little more later my little brother Dean is here he's never ridden the hoverboard before it might be too much hoverboard in these vlogs whatever I'm not going to stop okay Dean you want to ride the hoverboard it's really easy to just step on it and go here we better take it out to the street actually of course Dean is the only person on planet earth who gets it first try he's literally the only person who figured it out first time driving on the curb whoo lunch all right later our little brother Dean didn't he looks very cool when I found him on his motorcycle before he wanted me to include this little video clip in the vlog so you guys will know that he's a good motorcyclist and really cool dude I'd like to apologize for the video quality it looks like he may have used an actual potato to film this hey I've got your clog when I left out today so provides that shot of me leaving the house with this shot here so yeah he can do wheelies that's pretty cool I wanted to shoot this fun scene until day's log using my big camera but then I noticed that the batteries were dead and then we didn't have the right battery I'm going to go to the store to get the right batteries for the right microphone and then come back and then shoot the scene for the vlog so I was at the beach today and this lovely woman whose name escapes me said Katie why don't you make a movie to help sell the lighthouse in the lighthouse Inn is this gigantic mansion house that was a hotel and now it's just kind of abandoned I'm not interested in selling it but I thought I'd make like a little history lesson about the lighthouse Inn alright quick history lesson the lighthouse in this thing which was owned by one guy his name was Jeffrey and just kind of parenthetically Guthrie is the name of the beach that we go to that is all the way down here got three beach anyways he used to owned all this land here before it was turned all these houses okay back to my history lesson the lighthouse in here he like sold it in the 30s or the 20s or something they turned it into a hotel and the hotels had like a whole bunch of different ownership over the years and I have like kind of a personal connection to it in that my whole on wait for it my mother's third marriage the wedding for my mother's third I'm serious third marriage was here and then like all of my grandmother's parties after her taps shows were always here and like we would do family dinners and like holidays in this place then some lady is some like rich lady bought it and she put a whole bunch of money into it and then she got arrested because apparently she wasn't paying her employees and she skipped town something like this this is probably like 80% accurate what I'm saying I think they put her in jail and the place has just sort of been dilapidated and slowly falling apart since then and totally like everyone in this town wants it to sell and somebody to make it into a beautiful hotel I have zero interest in that what I want is for it to remain like all gross like it is now and for it to stay quiet what's kind of cool is when this place was shut down it was super abrupt like literally everything in this old haunted mansion house was left like someone just walked away so I'm going to finish this history lesson with a montage of creepy cinematic shots that I'm going to use this zoom lens to get I think the city owns it now and honestly I'm pretty sure you can buy it for like a dollar if you're willing to put the millions and millions into it to make it nice but I really mean it when I say I don't want this place to sell the last thing I want in my neighborhood is a busy restaurant and hotel with drunk people and noise and I don't want any of that what I love having in my neighborhood is a creepy old haunted mansion and that's the story of the lighthouse Inn okay I think that's it the house is locked up canvas is waiting outside and we're leaving now you what happened I'm just so happy we're in a business let's go got the upgrade fun it's early my friend just texted me is on his way here we're going early-morning surfing yeah why do you look so chipper that's why I'm feeling Sean I've been up for hours who's ready to serve we already wait county line will be less crowded and yeah let's cloud let's crown it the wrong way you think two of you you feed there this is tight yeah let's take two cars not even close Thanks we're going to county line which is a surf beach that I mainly know about from the Beach Boys song what song is it the county line how does it go what is going on 9 a.m. on a Tuesday how is it this many adults can be out playing on the beach at 9 a.m. on a Tuesday isn't anyone here work we're heading into it can't remember the last time I went surfing sit it is now 6:40 p.m. the day is nearly over we fly back to New York at 11:20 tonight but now it seems like a great time okay because tonight we are traveling back to New York City the theme of today's Q&amp;A is travel all right first question is from you Casey Newton what is the least terrible domestic airline I don't know it's either virgin or JetBlue are the least terrible they're all terrible JetBlue or virgin is probably the least terrible Roderigo asks what do you like the most what do you hate the most about traveling what I hate the most is the indignity that is airport security forcing people to take off their clothes and their shoes and stand there like this and be patted down that's the worst part the best part of travel is the unknown as ubiquitous and accessible as information is in this day and age to actually experience something truly new and travel affords that in a way that nothing else does this question dovetails nicely into my last answer why does traveling feel so good it feels so good because of that like surprise and delight you don't know what you're getting yourself into so it's a surprise and then it's almost always amazing so you're you're delighted with that experience and those two sensations are just like our magic best travel companion without question Owen my son because he's like tough he's down for anything he's not afraid of real adventure and he doesn't complain and on top of all that he's my kid so I'm always in charge and it's never like a democracy like what do we want to do it's a dictatorship dad makes the decisions parenthetically the very worst travel companion is my wife Candace what tips can you give someone who wants to travel more traveling by land is extremely underrated trains driving motorcycles bicycles really incredible travel doesn't always mean getting on an airplane and flying to another continent did you ever have much success upgrading airline seats before you had premium status I made a movie a little while ago about how to get free business class and it's all about status the only way to get status is to fly a lot otherwise upgrades just don't exist unless you have that status which means you fly a lot Josh Crocker any favorite travel vloggers yes fun for Louie great Ben brown probably my favorite I'll link both of them below incredible travel vloggers both those guys are always running around the world and they share it in a way that it's just like intimate and real it's like you're traveling with a friend when you watch their vlogs I'll link them below claudia asks what's the longest light you've ever been on non-stop the longest flight in the world which is from New York City to Singapore or New York City to Hong Kong I can't remember I was with my good friend Oscar boysson and it was a blast I was like sad when we landed how does flying not scare you there's so many good things to be scared of in this world but air travel how often do you get told to stop skateboarding in the airport I don't know maybe like half the time and the thinking about skateboarding or breaking any rules in the airport is the minute you're told not to you just stop and you say I'm sorry you pick up the skateboard and you go on your way never pick a fight in the airport there's just too much tension in there already most interesting person you sat next to in first class I said next to Wiz Khalifa ones it was awesome I think he might have been stoned you had me crazy travel stories that you haven't shared yes I do okay good question this would be the last question can you tell us about your scariest flight ever yes this was at the height of the war like 2010 and resuming for dramatic effect here and the plane itself had no markings on the outside just a blank white plane and what was particularly scary was in order for us to land in the airport in Bagram Air Force Base we first flew over the air base like this and then we flew in a circle around like that and then landed and the reason why we did that is because if you come in like this they would shoot you down as you got close to the ground so we had to get above it and then circle down and then the minute we landed a US soldier boarded the plane with a gun and he said give me your passports and when you get out of the plane make sure we can see your hands and your hats are off I don't know what that detail scared the crap out of me there were definitely guns on us because they didn't know who we were at that point in time that is by far the scariest airplane experience of my travel career okay that's concludes this week's QA um Jack one anecdote about travel go ah what is known about travel go you makes it easier that's so you want to want to want to see Jack get in there swatch hey Jack how many times you flown private ah like six or seven yeah that's Jack that Jack's belt that's a tripod this is my belt that's my camera and that's what it's hanging off of you think is gonna hold jack yeah that's why you always wear a belt there is no recovery from that fall for this [Music] the hotter so hot that was just over seven miles on a 6:58 pace yeah I'm dying over here [Music] today specifically today the Tuesday after Labor Day always feels like the first day of the year for me everybody mentally has gotten over summer it's back to work from here it's just a dead sprint to Thanksgiving you owe me this yeah we got to get this out of the roof okay [Music] Yeah right there's good that's happened and if it's broken I dropped the camo I dropped the camera yeah I can't get the focus I got broke it yeah it's broken just climbed all the way up here and dropped the camera again it's fully broken look at that no it's definitely broken I can't really fault Canon for this one I dropped this thing three times in a row it's totally broken okay that was completely unnecessary welcome to this week's Q&amp;A Jeebs asks how do you define work where does the concept of work begin and end for you how I personally feel about work is when I discovered something I love doing I decided then in there to do that for the rest of my life and figure out how to make a living at that and figure out how to survive off of that and for me that's that's making movies making videos sharing ideas and that's what beam is and that's what these videos are do you like reptiles no kind of a what no why do you only bleep out your cuss words you know I didn't used to and if you look at my old movies I swear like a sailor some mom emailed me and she said my kid loves watching your videos but I won't let him because you swear and I don't know that profanities make this vlog better so I just take out when I swear and if other people want to swear that's sort of fine there's not much thought to it honestly how did you meet jack in neat is spelt me-80 you know I just Jack started working with me like five years ago I think he started as an intern and is just like kind of them working with me ever since Jack now runs community for beam along with myriad other responsibilities but you know he is like he's an essential part of the team and a friend what made you want to be a youtuber I love that YouTube is something that we can all do and when I worked in television I didn't feel like it was something we could all do it was something for the privileged few that's what I love about YouTube I love being part of something that was big and egalitarian and accessible to all and a venue where I could share my ideas and perspectives uninhibited that's what turned me on the most about YouTube how tall am i somewhere between like 5 foot 10 and 6 foot 4 closer to 5 foot 10 right at 5 foot 10 I'm 5 foot 10 Breana asks what's your favorite social media platform ah okay besides my own besides bean I like Twitter a lot I love Instagram I love snapchat but since I started vlogging I don't use snapchat much anymore and I love social media in general any social media that's positive I love red it freaks me out Moe asks better to go to film school in LA or New York City I don't know I didn't go to film school I am not qualified to answer that question last question because the Sun setting early mornings or late night without question early mornings I love waking up in the morning I eat sleep and I usually get up like 5:00 every day which means by the time it's late night I'm miserable so I am 100% a morning person anybody wants to buy a lens I know a place where you yelling for keep slightly used by the way in case you forgot this is where I currently am human ages what is he doing over there hey Jack alright now I'm gonna get down pardon me sir I bought this lens here and it stopped working so I

restaurant is blasting hip-hop music despite the fact that it's 7 a.m. excited for the day also I have like one day in Mexico City I'm leaving tomorrow I'm speaking later tonight so I plan on taking full advantage of this afternoon I rained out this morning so didn't seem appropriate to bust out the boosted board less-than-ideal penny boarding conditions then this guy is really tripping up on the transportation to skateboards and rollerblades woman's got the poodle market on lockdown not sure what's going on here today in Mexico City but there are so many like police officers and security and like crossing guards and traffic and there's a helicopter that keeps buzzing overhead something interesting is going down those guys there those guys there there there there top there they're just like everywhere no idea what I wandered into here but everybody seems pretty passionate about whatever it is nice Ted that's good that's not bad oh my god what is this what is this Duncan Jake already doing the protesting protesting because they want the energy costs to go down electricity or fear they're also demanding the rights how the students were killed here in Mexico at one point yeah the government killed them and all my you know the Quran is that that exists here in Mexico I'm in the bathroom of Starbucks just outside the door here are three or four police officers with riot shields and helmets don't know what's going on or check this out the hotel here the protest grub my hotel rooms I came back out now look at the situation some and our kiss there yeah how was your journey over here I got all wit fear and a lot like um Habsburg my car so what was the protest a one year ago 43 people were killed here in Mexico students and they disappeared like they completely disappeared people don't know what happened to them and they found DNA of two of them in a river but there are no bodies so the people is really mad with the government because they still do not accept what happened and they cannot explain what it is so this is one year after that and the streets are full I couldn't even get here I had to walk that's it glad you made it ready how far away is it it is not far away but the problem is the traffic is going crazy now so let's see okay we're headed to the festival the event now I'm taking one Pablo with me what are we doing it's raining out here yeah we're

misled we should totally follow tonight your leftover Thai food for breakfast one of the questions I get asked a lot is where did I come up with the idea to make a movie to make any of my movies the answer is always kind of the same it's whatever whatever piques my interest enough to want to examine it more by making a movie about it that question sort of gave me an idea for a new segment in the vlog where I sort of break down and examine one of the movies I've made in the past I hope this isn't totally boring oh also these aren't real glasses there's no lenses in them and there's only one arm but they look kind of cool on me right I mean I also broke them and this is auditing our closet getting rid of all the stuff she doesn't think you need there's a little bit of a point of contention between the two of us because I happen to think you do need 45 extra extension cords laying around I also see no reason whatsoever which I want to get rid of this [Music] okay so here's my setup I'm gonna sit here with the camera going this way on this TV all like superimposed the actual video and I'll talk the camera like this and then I'll have my laptop here the actual video playing so I know what I'm referring to this is gonna work so this is the first behind-the-scenes segment where I talk about a movie I've made in the past and tell you stories about how it came to be starting with a movie called bike lanes this is a movie is one the first like breakout YouTube movies I made it did like 5 million views in the first day to date it's done 13 million views it was a big movie for me if you haven't seen this movie yet stop this video this won't make any sense go and watch it you can click right here even on mobile click right here don't see the movie it's like three minutes long then come back so in this movie get pulled over on my bike by NYPD they give me a ticket for riding outside of the bike lanes which is really stupid sort of protest it I rode in the bike lanes and crashed into everything I ran into some technical behind the scenes I shot this movie well my friend Oscar helped me shoot this movie but we shot it on this which is like $199 Canon camera then I think we oh look at that still turns on sorry to interrupt just a quick question I'm doing like a behind the scenes of my claims do you have anything like anecdotal you want to add to it like of that special day there is that moment when I was like well we should make a movie where you ride in the bike lane no but I think I did I did the cop car we had to go back for the cop car was not shot on the same day as everything else everything else happened though in like an hour thanks Oscar real time sorry to stir back to business is the history of the bike lane down yeah something like that bye guys okay so now let's start the movie I'm getting a ticket for riding my bike not in the bike lane okay first question didn't the cop get mad at you when you were filming him yes but it's like we're protected under the First Amendment you're allowed to film police officers while they're making an arrest as long as you're not obstructing them so there wasn't a whole lot he could do or say so I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane but often there are obstructions that keep you from probably riding in the bike okay the red bike right there I bought that at Kmart for 89 bucks the morning of this shoot so I didn't want to mess up my my good bike did I get hurt the answer's no I didn't get hurt at all I'm very good at falling and none of these Falls are that bad I just made them look dramatic for effect the bike didn't completely break by the end of the day though it was it was actually this radio show when I was on this radio show that I was like I have to make a movie out of this because I was on the radio show for the exact thing that I was so upset about I wish I had known that before it paid the $50 check did well so everybody always asks did you get your $50 back no I didn't but it's not a big deal I got like made this great movie and I was really proud of this movie so there was so much press I was like on so many different news shows talking about this and I became this advocate for cycling in New York City really proud of like that silly movie that movie cost me almost no money to make I used really primitive hardware and software to make it and I put it up on YouTube when I might have had a couple of hundred subscribers [Music] I will see you workaholics later have a good weekend I say workaholics but I'll probably see you tomorrow Matt for some person weekend work the bad guy [Music] what I think what obviously [Music] I [Music] thank you so yesterday's vlog ended with me saying that I don't feel well really don't feel good I got home last night and had a temperature of 102 I just kind of passed out face down on the couch fully clothed look up this morning feeling better though I think there's some visitors outside my office this morning what's up guys like we spent the night you don't believe me that's probably because we don't sweet man gentlemen paid to meet you thank you what's your in Edward well I'm from Arkansas Bert will place in here hey William what's up that's gonna get fat I know just being honest guys of all of them [Music] let's begin with the old hoverboard this thing is by far the best for indoor use these things are just impractical outdoors I would go as far say they're dangerous outdoors because you want to go faster you think you can go faster but you hit like a critical mass on these and they just become really really dangerous so it makes it really practical for like getting around the home the office hotels airports etc it's also relatively inexpensive you currently get them on Amazon for three hundred and seventy four dollars and like that's a lot of money but but compared to like the 1,800 bucks they did cost and they first came out it seems a little bit more reasonable okay is the one-wheel this is a bold statement but I will go on the record to say the one-wheel is the most fun of any of these crazy devices you can ride it off-road it's good at the beach like you can beat the crap out of this thing it's really fast and awesome it has no controller so you just lean and it goes and where it really gets tricky is how to turn it you sort of like you grow up on an edge like it's a snowboard or like it's a surfboard literally you lean on the edge as you're moving it carves like that which makes it insanely fun especially on the sand it's expensive $1,500 but this thing's pretty wild and it is absurdly fun next up is the sbu that would be self that would be the self-balancing unicycle the self-balancing unicycle what can I say about this thing it's a marvel of engineering it only works at speed so when you're like really cruising on this thing like flying down the road it's crazy fun super fast really awesome means a fast work but indoors and like trying to go slow in front of the camera to show you how it works and the self-balancing unicycle the sbu is also expensive it's like $1,800 the boosted board this is a longboard that's like made out of bamboo so it's super flexible look it's got two high powered motors down here and you control it with this thing now what I really love about this thing and I'm a huge fan of the boosted board by the way this gigantic arrow is not stock believe it or not I put that on there myself what's amazing about the boosted board is it is like I use it like a like it's how I get around town now so I use it as like an actual practical means of transportation I've like ridden this thing to midtown i zoom all over the city on it these wheels can handle almost any pothole and the power is just not to be underestimated if you just handle almost anything these things are 1,500 bucks that's it on the website [Music] if I could only pick one one thing to ride for the rest of my life it would be my skateboard this thing's like a hundred bucks and got no motor you can't roll it by putting one foot here and then you pump with the other foot you look cool riding it [Music] right now riding a boosted board while carrying a hoverboard next to Jack who has a skateboard the one we all and a unicycle I didn't work out this morning okay I was going to end the skateboard motorized scooter segment of the vlog there but these showed up in the mail today and my biggest frustration with this thing with the boosted board in particular is that I use this to get around New York City but at night it's really scary because it's like dark outside I did a little bit of research and by research I mean I did a single search on Amazon and I found these things led under-under globe board lighting literally lights for your skateboard specifically okay that's awesome now I just have to wait for the Sun to set and test this baby out [Music] see that foot outline that mark right there it's sort of shaped like a foot the reason why that there is so you know exactly where to place your foot to find the center of gravity to do this cool right it is it is just after 6:00 a.m. I got up super early this morning to take some time lapses of this amazing town it's so pretty so I'm back at MIT today super excited about that love being in Cambridge love working with with the folks at the Media Lab Owen will be up at MIT this week as well this is his spring break at school and he's doing a student internship curious what its gonna be like to work side-by-side with the kid parenting it's like an enigma wrapped up in a mystery I really wish I spent more time with this house needs to be here all the time it's just gotten so tricky with the baby do me a solid if you should ever find yourself in New London Connecticut come to muddy waters cafe go in look to the old guy behind the counter say hello that's my dad just don't expect anything for free boys hate dad yeah joined MIT five pops I'm gonna take my coffee and run I'll be back in New York probably Saturday I'll see you saturday fine dad thanks for the coffee this car gets about eight miles to the gallon extremely illegally but right back for it got three of my favorite people in the whole world just chilling out working here hey Owen how's work hey that how much of this cake did you eat Owen zero zero and I just realized I forgot to put money in the meter right there's the meter maid stupid ticket that's my iphone there and I want to use the window as like tripod for it I mean it's kind of like the perfect tripod but if it falls that's pretty severe so far so good so I should start by saying ivory recorded this scene like three times and I seldom do that with these vlogs what you see is what actually happened and you can trust that but I said I would mention or I would talk about my new business in today's vlog and I'm super anxious about it see I feel almost dishonest and not having shared the details of my new company on the vlog yet this vlog is about me it's about what I'm up to it's about my life and this company is my life it's my only focused career wise it's the reason why I'm no longer doing advertising it's how I spend the vast majority of all of my time in the office but there are very legitimate not that legitimate but there are legal reasons why I can't get into the specifics of what I'm doing so all I can tell you is that my new company will be a very big part of this vlog moving forward but there are some very specific short-term legal hurdles that we have to overcome before I can really share with you what I'm up to I hope you will bear with me continue to watch my vlog and trust that in the future in the very near future I will be sharing the details of everything that I'm up to on this vlog that's all I got and I are gonna go to the mall where's that kid we're gonna go to the mall really quickly just do a little father-son shopping thank you I wouldn't put my hair yeah today's vlog is going to have really good time lapses because I basically spent the entire day shooting time lapses summer speeds this awesome thing that the city does every summer where they shut down an entire street the whole way down the city an Avenue the whole length of the city and they just let people walk and ride bikes and hang out and there are no cars it's amazing the in-laws are here we're walking the baby summer streets is over now we're in the park Franny is doing better we had a little toothache earlier twofers are coming in yeah now nope don't mess with the camera Oh trying to get home now we took an uber we probably should have walked traffic is miserable without on the electric skateboard going to get snacks for Candace to me and I think I just spotted one of my favorite people in local oh my god buddy I love that guy Candace and the baby are home now I've been sent on a mission to go get food and then a little later today I need to do something I've done a very long time which is to go on a time-lapse mission around New York City I know the time-lapse is in my vlogs and be getting a little snail as the plane I want to go shoot all new ones today so it's a lot later than I wanted to get out to go shoot some time lapse but I've still got plenty of Sun to get a couple of shots first stop is going to be underneath the Williamsburg Bridge it's a pretty amazing view of Brooklyn down there and I haven't filmed down there yet so whoa watch it what's up all right time-lapse session in full effect I got one going here another one going right here and then I got my GoPro right there check out these jet skiers man does that look like fun so this is a particularly rich spot for time-lapse this year my cameras are a little spaced out here though there's two here and then one all the way over there so keep a close eye on them I'm moving to location 2 now so all of my vlogs start with a time-lapse and you have for a couple reasons number one it's really pretty and fun to look at out I don't people paying attention number two it's like we're the two most important pieces of information when watching a vlog for me it's like where is it and what time is it so I start my vlogs with a time and a location and the time-lapse helps like reinforce the location header location number two right now for time-lapse and that's going to be right underneath the Brooklyn Bridge Yeah right here from this location here I was able to shoot like I think six different setups or seven different setups I take the helmet off when I do the shooting I'm just about to leave the fight for the background but this one's probably my favorite I shot on the little camera it's kind of like a perfect half of that side half of this side and then the lights just amazing this is probably the weakest camera I have when it gets the job done okay next location is going to be the pier at the South Street Seaport I think I should be able to get good views of lower Manhattan from under there not sure but I think so this is the pier here honestly don't know if I've ever been on the South Street Seaport Pier as long as I've lived in New York City a lot going on out here all right that was a really good Vantage but a lot of people and people kept talking to me because only a weirdo has six cameras rolling at once and they made it really hard to actually get anything done so I'm going to try to move to the room to the other side of the island right now and catch the last of the sunset over there I'm on the east side now going to the west side all right it's just about dark the Sun is set which usually means the end of time lapses but there's one more set up that I want to get but I think I can get it dust and then I get to get home so Candice doesn't divorce me so this is the last set up this is like a Canyon shot here looking up this street with the World Trade Center there that was last one I want to get that I'm going home and this is it somewhat poetic end to an otherwise very successful shoot wah-wah-wah daddy's camera that daddy's camera so I swung out please survive today is date or today's my last day at VidCon sad to be leaving but really excited to get home and see Francine and Candice and get back to normal I'm giving my keynote talk this morning here which is on the main stage so there should be a good crowd I haven't prepared for it yet but I've got an idea yo good morning what are we doing now we got to go check in get you prepped the microphones going and then we're going to eat some food

out here somebody's smoking some pot again just wanted to say thank you for all the amazing presents that everyone sent me especially for this sweet watch hey guys my name is Julie I live in Taiwan do you want to see a school that everyone wears when uniform follow me on TV baby be my fake face see what high school life is like in Taiwan you I can't talk super loud because the baby's asleep I'm home alone Candace's at work not much of a vlog today but I did some vlogging this morning we went to breakfast it wasn't very good we just finished breakfast and the baby lost her shoe baby lost her shoe then Candace bought a bunch of fashion magazines Candace is buying fashion magazines no she spent eighty one dollars eighty one dollars on magazines then we went inside Jerome's new apartment we're in Jerome's new apartment hi I'm Jerome then I walked through Chinatown now we're on a walk in Chinatown then we went home to give the baby a nap now we're going on to give the baby a nap and that's kind of it that's been my whole day putting the baby to sleep now good night very well the reason why there's a short vlog today is because later this afternoon I'm releasing a very special video last week I released my first 360 video did really well got like a million views but everybody had the same criticism which is that the resolution wasn't high enough the image was too mushy so today September 14th at 3 p.m. I'm going to be releasing a new 360 video this one is razor sharp it's so sharp that if you're not careful when you touch the screen you might cut yourself it's 8,000 lines of resolution what does that mean the last 360 video we shot at 1080 so 1000 lines of resolution this one we shot at 8k and it's on YouTube in 4k so you can watch it at crazy resolution also it works really good on a phone but honestly we shot this thing on such high-end gear you'd be better off find a computer that has a really good internet signal so you can watching them 4k and really get into it on a computer some other things to know if you're on a Mac you can navigate around the screen using these keys alright that's it so tune in today 3 p.m. for the launch of my new 360 video it's going to be dope do you want to see what I'm going to play with until Francine wakes up I've got this to keep me busy what you just saw there those are fresh bananas being grown in a Vermont rest stop this is what is called a living machine that's purifying all the water used here now I live in New England and I love to show you guys these very interesting things on beam so follow me at Oliver Ames

going to pack up we're going to leave soon Candace the baby's ready I think part of the reason why I still love New York City after living there for 14 years is I always leave the city for the most part I've come to Connecticut every week since I moved there 14 years ago and like any good relationship some distance can really make you appreciate what you have Saturday family travel today we are driving to the house in Connecticut right now I'm going to get the car with the stroller the puppy the diaper bags because that's what dads do I think that's our car yep that's the car you guys ready

to come out next week so most of you will be able to get in sorry that we have to do that we just have to be responsible if too many people come in everybody's experience will kind of suck question do you think I can ride this thing on the beach wait so you're not even working out yeah no showers it was like it's much water good luck with your exercise okay early-morning gym situation it is pouring rain outside and apparently there's some flooding going on here at the gym wet its kind of gross outside this morning I appreciate it though kind of nice what you end up doing just getting really pissed to be honest with you how'd you get to work out this morning I feel terrible nothing well you just went back home no I just came here and started working I'm gonna try and leave later and do something but I'm really frustrated here's an exercise ball check yeah there you go Jack there you go Jack get it get it this showed up in the middle it says dry shampoo I don't know what that is somebody sent this to Carly but care of Casey which means I don't know what that means but I think it means that I can use it I don't know how dry shampoo would work holy smokes whoa it smells like my grandmother oh good job kids I would recommend not using dry shampoo if you care at all for your safety or for the life of your hair dude do not put this stuff on especially near a fire okay I'm going to stop it smells like an old folks home in here it is Tuesday afternoon that means QA time all right questions any dollar pizza alternatives yes and I want to be really clear on this dollar pizza is terrible I do not recommend you come to New York City and fry dollar pizza there are some amazing pizza places in this town my favorite slice in the city is called Joe's pizza it's in the West Village it's like 275 per slice of pizza it's amazing don't do dollar pizza that place is toxic what's your favorite US city outside of New York City I love Los Angeles how do you overcome the fear of doing what you like I'm not entirely sure what you're asking but taking chances in your career taking chances in life is always scary and typically if it's something you really like something you're passionate about it requires taking a chance to pursue that what I always ask myself the question always push up against is what is the alternative like if I don't do what I love if I don't pursue this thing that I want to pursue what is the alternative I do something that I don't like because I'm supposed to fear is real fear something you always have to confront but what's on the other side of fear is always something something that's that's worth it Casey I would love to share with you my app idea okay now I'm going to try not to sound like a total Apple when I answer this but I feel like this relationship is about truth that I have to tell you how I honestly feel when people not just this person but anyone says I have an app idea I'd love to talk to you about I don't want to hear your idea ideas especially in technology and in filmmaking ideas are the easiest part in technology in particular you can look at an app and say an app should do this that's a great idea but realizing that is unbelievably hard the seed that is the idea it very seldom ends up manifesting into what the final version of that app looks like what I mean by that is like when Twitter was started it was a way to let your friends know when you're at a rave or a concert like that's what Twitter was that was their intention behind Twitter it had like a little idea that wasn't even a great idea but years and years of work in hundreds and now thousands and tens of thousands of employees and millions of users turn into something much much much greater and that's the hard part the idea is the easy part if you want to make something make it and show it to me I'd love to see it but I'm not interested in the idea can you make your vlogs longer no when I watch a movie that's too short but I really like I'm always like ah that was great I wish there was more and when I see a movie that I really love like trainwreck I saw this weekend it was great but it was like 20 minutes too long so I left thinking not that was a great movie I just left thinking that was too long so it always rather leave the viewer I'd always rather be left as the viewer wishing for more then I would being left with like that was too much plus I just have time like that's crazy it takes me like half the day to make six minutes of interesting content I wouldn't know how to do 20 Amanda asks do you have any advice for a high school now I only went to a little bit of high school but I do have some advice and that's this when you're in a high school it feels like that is the entire world like that is your whole universe and when you grow up and you get old like me you realize it's not like high school is just a little blip and this huge thing that you call life even in this huge thing that you call education high school is only this tiny little piece of that so hang in there work really hard and know that high school is just it's a moment in your life do you still have the first thing that you built in your office that's a great question and yes I do okay the very first thing that I built in this studio was this my overhead shooting rig this is what I use to like film all my animations and the monitors here the camera goes here it shoots straight down and the reason why this surface here is so messed up is because this was the actual piece of wood that the original shooting table was made on it never been changed for the last 13 years I don't think I'll ever change it it's too awesome okay and this concludes QA for this week more next week thank you for your questions all right hey finally in the blog yeah Nathan here I'm headed up to 26th Street now to go to a recording studio for this podcast the trouble is it's about to thunderstorm and rain out and the boosted board for all of its virtues does not work in the rain at all some kind of rolling the dice here okay crossing Canal Street no rain yet so far so good alright 8th Street it's starting to rain just like a light sprinkle okay I made the location just barely raining boosted words wet but I think it survived well hey man hi oh goodness yeah this one a podcasting studio looks like this what well this is what this idiom looks like I mean it's uh this is us yeah this is where uh you're gonna sit there and I'm gonna sit here Josh here josh is like a would you describe yourself as a technology journalist a journalist uh roots in technology journalism yeah that's I'm so excited about that this is a great interview I appreciate you giving you the time really appreciate it yeah thankful happy to be around for that's it we just finished the podcast anybody he's dudes here like the counterfeit handbag mafia my goal is to always make it through here without getting murdered day yeah I mean sorry I have my snapchat set so anybody can send me snaps like people I don't know strangers and stuff and the snap that I get the most are from people and it just says bored or it's like a selfie of them and they're like bored nothing to do how are this many people that have all this time and no way to occupy it you could build a city with all the free time that people spend sitting around being bored sending me snaps of themselves sitting around being bored mix it up the format a little bit today's vlog is gonna be about one theme one thing only first I gotta make some props you read what that says that is a fluorescent light that hangs above my office door that says work harder it also says the same thing tattooed on my wrist just in case I forget so today's vlog is about time management and productivity I really want to get into it Seneca said it's not that we have a short time to live but that we waste a lot of it Thank You Ryan for turning me on to that quote and that pretty much sums it up right now it's go time for me I want to maximize every waking second I'm never going to get any younger but right now I'm completely healthy I'm full of energy and who knows how long this will last I doubt it's going to be like that when I'm 50 or 60 years old so I want to do it now with that I wanted to share a little bit of my thinking behind that like a little bit of the logic and then the mechanics behind maximizing or my consideration for really maximizing every day and I know that this is like this is this is crazy person talk but the truth is the only time I really get bummed out or depressed is is what I'm not being productive is when I'm not accomplishing or doing or contributing in any way nothing makes me less happy than relaxation and sitting around with nothing to do what I'm doing here with the Domino's this paper tape measure this overhead shot is I'm going to do an animation of of my day what I think of as a pretty productive day and how I sort of manage my time the dominoes are broken into six different color categories for the tape first is white and that is free time next up is black black is sleep red is work orange is exercise and blue Blues family time last is purple and purple is like fun or partying or playing video games that's purple here are your 24 hours this is kind of how my day looks so starting at 7 a.m. I like to get in 1 to 3 hours of exercise immediately heading into work at 10 a.m. 6 7 ok then I get home at 7 p.m. and that's what I do family time so putting the baby to bed you know stuff like that that usually goes till about 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. so then starting at 10:00 p.m. when Candice goes to bed that's usually when I edit this vlog so from 10 p.m. until 1 a.m. I'm back at work so I 1 a.m. I go to bed and that's when I sleep and I sleep from 1 a.m. usually till about 5 a.m. and then I get up at 6:00 and from 6 to 7 is when I do email so then that's sneaking in one more hour of work so this is my day this is what almost every day looks like there's a slight shift in the weekend this is like a pretty grueling schedule and the reason why it looks like this is this worked I'm here from 10:00 a.m. till 7:00 p.m. my workday it's fairly typical workday this is the time spent working on my new company this is the time I've spent focusing on building this business I pull some minutes out of there to try to catch up shooting this vlog but for the most part my day time my day job is a full-time 50 plus hours a week focus on my new company so then where do I make this vlog where do I work on this vlog I had to steal some hours here from sleep these hours otherwise from 10:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. would be sleep from 6 a.m. till 7 a.m. that would be sleep time is the most precious resource for me right now in life this is the most valuable thing I have and that's why I'm so protective of my time why I'm so emphatic about all this is that I think life is substantiated by whatever impact or whatever contribution you can make while you're alive the finish line is the same for everyone we're all ending up in the same place but while we're here what what contribution can you make work and building things and making things and doing things and spending time with your family those are the ways that I feel I'm contributing that I'm accomplishing something so why wouldn't I want to maximize my time as efficiently as possible to be as effective as I can with that and that is why I say free time is the enemy of progress because free time sitting around is not doing and that's why I try to omit that entirely from my life last one out of the office today for fantasy god it may not even fit her chubby babies [Music] what's up dude you look tired man so beat right now you're really gonna sleep on the plane are you out raging last night [Music] we're just arriving at the airport now ready this is my second day in a row vlogging from the airport so let me know in the comments below if this

still using the blackberry okay then the internet went a little bit bezerk as the Internet does and this kid on the internet made him like a indie go-go by Marlin an iPhone thing anyways it's it's been fully funded this is it okay this is Marlin this phone was photoshopped into his hand they wanted to raise 808 raise 807 this is like a message from the kid that did organize the whole thing this little video that he made which is like the iPhone let's replace old Blackberry and give him something awesome you can help us reach this goal by donating back a brand new phone really excited to tell

Candice Candice movies over it was pretty great Candice is calling her mother to check on the baby this might be the end of the date but maybe not so we got a little time it's really like pretty and romantic looking here but you should see how many rats are running around right under our feet can to show me a rat well there were a couple on the program see these rats under here there they are huge where are you going did you see those rats carrying trash yeah a big white trash bag Oh goodbye [Music] man what a difference a night of sleep makes I feel like a new man today you know what I'm talking about [Music] okay so today today is QA day but before I get into the questions and answers segment I want to do a gratuitous Steadicam skateboard shot of Jack and I going through the streets of New York City here we go [Music] all right glad I got that glad I got that out of my system now I'm covered in sweat I also just destroyed my jeans ok let's start the Q&amp;A all right this will definitely be the sweatiest Q&amp;A I've done yet ah let's get started Raj in a tense situation would you run away or fight and why okay generally my feeling about violence is to avoid it at all costs so always run away except in one of three situations the first is if you have to defend yourself like if it's you or then make sure it's always them number two is if you have to defend someone who can't defend themselves like a kid or a girl or something then you fight and three and this was a little bit more controversial to defend the honor of a woman meaning if someone is humiliating or saying things about a girl and she can't defend herself I believe forces necessary to end that but as a rule avoid fights at all costs avoid violence at all costs the last time I got into a fight was probably like seven or eight years ago and it's kind of a funny story Candace and I were like having an argument on Broadway middle of New York City and this somewhat imposing figure came over to us interrupted our fight and was like trying to sell us candy it's like a scam that guys do in New York City and we said no and like he wouldn't back off and eventually he walked away and like turned to Candace and he was like him and you watch and like you just can't talk to a woman like that then things got violent next question who this is a good one I like this a lot Maddy asks what's the least favorite movie you've ever made it's actually hold on Maddy okay I'm just covering up the name of the musician but see how it says biggest mistake ever that was a music video my brother Dan and I directed in 2004 it just wasn't right we should have said no but we were dead broke and it was the first like real opportunity to do something for real like a real it was a music video so we did it it came out terribly no one was happy and to this day certainly has been like biggest mistake ever and from that mistake I learned so much about when you say yes and when you say no to two gigs that involve money okay awesome question from Alex if you had a time machine would you go back in life and do something differently yes if I had a time machine I would go back and be born in the year 1899 that means I could fight in World War one I could fight in World War two and then I could grow up and have my adult years go through from like 1940 to 1980 like the height of like American engineering when like it was really americo's at its finest and then died in the early 80s just before the internet was born Alberto how have the daily vlogs impacted your channel tremendously growth is off the charts like so many viewers so many new people coming to the channel all really exciting stuff and I still have like my canon of old movies like the first 100 movies I made were not vlogs so the channel the dynamic of it has really changed but for me it's like it's like this library of all the work I've made since I stopped working my brother in 2010 okay considering your passion for hard work is retirement in the cards there are two things that I hope I never have to deal with in life one is being sick that's my ultimate fear and then two is not being able to work so retirement is like the sum of all fears for me I hope I never have to retire I hope I die working I'll end the QA on this question with like a little story so my muse like my idol my hero in life is my grandmother and my Nana she died a couple years ago when she was 13 years old maybe she was younger when she was 13 years old she learned how to tap dance and that was like her passion her dream like the thing that inspired her more than anything in the world was tap dancing she didn't stop tap dancing for the next 80 years she literally tapped every single day she moved out of New York City to Connecticut she started a tap School in the 1950s she had a tap studio in her home that she liked taught children how to tap dancing she did a recital every year if you'd do a tap show for hundreds of people and she did that literally until the day before she died on a Friday she had tap class where she had 20 students in her class and she was on her feet tap tap tapping away and then the next day she went to the hospital and then she died that like if I could sign a contract and get that deal that's what I want out of life I want to pursue my passion and work until the very end I never want to retire I made a movie about my Nana that tells this story in more depth I'll link it below and then I'll put like a link thing here you should watch that movie she might be the most like inspirational human being I've ever met it might make you cry okay I am going to I'm going to go home now and change my pants actually I have to I have to walk home through the streets of New York City with my pants looking like this I don't guess I'll just blog it [Music] one of the more popular questions or I do these Q&amp;A is don't you get embarrassed walking around the streets of New York talking into a camera the answer is no and today that question would be don't you get embarrassed walking around in the streets of New York City talking to your camera while your pants are ripped in half and you know the answer is still no of all the freaks and weirdos in this town I'm still not even in the top 10% aren't I changed I feel better well the blue collared shirt and my red pants feel like I belong at a country club but sometimes you just got to roll with it [Music] this is like a weird inception thing hold on let's see if I can try to film this okay I'm talking to Jerome on on FaceTime and then Carly's here and then Carly's talking to Jerome and video and the whole thing I left the hoverboard at work last night was pouring out and writing nothing in the rain just seemed like a generally terrible idea what's up how's it going man so I'm on foot today which feels entirely awkward what do we have here so I've been riding my hoverboard a lot in these vlogs and I've been talking about it even more which is kind of annoying so I thought to like alleviate some of the pressure on both the hoverboard and the vlog then I would just like put a nail in the coffin by dedicating this entire vlog to the hoverboard [Applause] the hoverboard vlog is going to have four chapters chapter 1 functionality chapter 2 product review chapter 3 product improvement in chapter 4 how to buy these things that totally getting scammed by some con artists on the internet by ordering them directly from China chapter 1 begins now this is water not beer ah chapter 1 functionality also um I just open up a package whoever sent me these Cuban cigars thank you you know I don't smoke I don't know what I'll do with them but I appreciate you sending them by okay functionality so this thing it sort of looks like a Segway it's not a segment at all it has two pressure-sensitive pads here that let it know when something is standing on it and that activates the motor that's on either side of this thing I should also preface this by saying I am no way affiliated with this and everything I'm saying is just an assumption but I'm pretty good when it comes to engineering and things like that so it's probably pretty accurate you've got two pressure-sensitive pads that lets the device know that you're standing on it that activates each respective motor you get two independent motors here a single axis sort of combines them both there's an axle that runs through now how it knows which way to power that motor is you tip it forward and as long as that axle twists it means the right motor goes forward the left motor goes forward want them both to move they go like this you want to move in a circle took one back and one forward and that's pretty much how it works you got a single power button here you got the charging port there and that's pretty much it it has these lights on top I don't know what they mean that's battery I don't know what this one is then you've got these headlights down here which I can only assume are entirely superficial that's how you turn around whoa what happened okay I better demonstrate this on the floor power button is here tipnis record of turns to this foot for two terms on that side and that's kind of it there may be more elaborate instructions but they were in Chinese and I don't really subtractor to prod product review so I've had this for about a week now maybe a week and a half I feel like that makes me an authority on it as far as the hardware goes it is a really well-built device I've had to put some tape here to keep these little lights in place but besides that we've been beating the everliving shit out of this thing day in and day out I've been riding it in the rain I wrote it in sand on grass and it just keeps going thus far I have not noticed any sort of depreciation in either the power responsiveness or anything of the lights let's take this outside [Music] yeah don't think about it so much I've never seen those people before in my entire life okay back to the product review so if there's one problem with this thing you can't get up curves and the reason why that's lame is because the biggest concern is this thing with this step right now I need to go up the curb there's just no way and this leads me into the next chapter which I can't remember what I wrote down but it's about improvement and how this thing could be made better I think I have an idea as to how to make this hoverboard thing so it actually I can get up a step I can get up a curb I'm gonna do that now [Music] [Applause] [Music] but that's that problem solved okay last chapter that would be Chapter four how to buy these things and not get scammed by some con artists on the internet by buying it from China and this is something I take personally because I hate being ripped off and more than that I hate people that rip off other people let me compare with me here this is called a website called IO Hawk and they sell this device for seventeen hundred and ninety nine dollars that is one thousand seven hundred ninety nine dollars and ninety nine cents okay cool for you IO Hawk then there's this great business insider story here this business insider story talks about how all these celebrities have this expensive new gadget and it credits the gadget with this company called funky duck and funky duck is apparently a company with a couple of entrepreneurs to bring this funky duct product to the market blah blah blah okay and funky ducks are $1,500 okay then you can wander over to Amazon where you can buy this one called a mono Rover same device and it's five hundred and thirty-eight dollars so that's pretty cheap see you here five hundred and thirty eight dollars okay in case you're having trouble following long they're all the identical device from the same place with different names on them and then a price variation of over a thousand dollars so I went straight to the source figured out where these things were made and how to get them directly from the supplier now this is where it gets really interesting so if you do a little bit of the work and go to Alibaba here here's the exact product made in the same Factory here's your color variations that you want and here it costs a whopping see if you can see that two hundred and thirty dollars which is pretty great if you really want to get into it then you can go here and order straight from Guangdong China for a whopping 198 dollars and 50 cents so so there's plenty of opportunity here to spend $1700 on one of these things but I can just be a little bit resourceful go online figure out how to order it directly from China for 200 bucks and you have the same exact product made in the same exact factory for fifteen hundred dollars less than those other guys I don't mean to sound extreme when I say this but I don't think anyone has ever wanted anything as badly as I want dollar pizza right now [Music] but I oh good day just running to the office superfast to grab my skateboard yeah what's up got it on my way to breakfast at the usual spot I'm interviewing a candidate someone we're looking to hire at beam which by the way we're hiring like crazy at beam if you know anyone or you're someone who either is an Android or iOS developer email us at jobs at beam com we only want experienced people no hacks all right interview is over great interview great meeting great breakfast I'm now going over to my friend Jerome's house really quick Jerome's just starting out on YouTube and he's having major technical difficulties so I'm just going to help him out for a second that I have to get to work and they walked so how am i oh man welcome to the wonderful world of vlogging okay I've been it drummed for about an hour now trying to fix his Final Cut Pro 10 nonsense no scoop we didn't fix it I gotta go man your video is good jazz you'll never get it off your computer ah don't say that IBD heading back to the studio now I think it might be time today's kind of like a special presentation cue a more of a rant really than a regular Q&amp;A today I want to talk about haters and I do want to apologize right from the start I tend to get pretty passionate about this kind of thing so I am sorry for the bad language the biggest question that I see is how do you not let haters get to you and the truth is like haters get to me they bother me no one's immune to that like nobody likes to be put down but there are a couple of things that I remember first and foremost haters are losers haters are unquestionably losers they bring people down in hopes of elevating themselves but that's not how the world works if you're bringing someone else down you're going right there with them that is fact I want to address a couple of specific haters on here I don't want to mention them by name because I don't want to promote like negativity in the hopes that you might get a little attention but I often get comments on my vlogs that are like this is an advertisement like my McDonald's video where my friend Oscar and I went Nate McDonald's I've made advertisements before this right here this is a commercial for Nike this right here this is a commercial for Mercedes Benz I'm very open about that what would possess you to write in my comments that a video were on like bashing McDonald's is an advertisement for them are you a oh he's not gonna pull on over on me this is an advertisement I'm smarter than the world hero put in the comments you I've worked in advertising a decade you don't get paid for like that the reason why I take it so personally when people suggest that is I'm very open about when I'm doing advertising I wouldn't try to pull one over on you my audience by tricking you by making some video about Lakes and fast-food that's actually an advertisement or yesterday I posted the iPhone video like a video I shot on an iPhone Apple didn't pay me for that Apple to mean give me that phone in fact if Apple found out how I got that phone I bet they'd be pissed off but thank you again commenting geniuses for saying that Apple paid me to make that video God people are so stupid and they love to highlight their stupidity in the comments next comment that really got to me somebody wrote that Candace has no ass look human beings we come in all different shapes and sizes we're all beautiful in our own way never pick on someone because of the way they look you can't help the way you look you've got to judge people by their substance not by their superficiality it is truth that better-looking people have it easier in this world so if you want to pick on someone pick on really attractive people because they don't have to work as hard as you were me they just show up and smile I'm sorry if you're really beautiful and watching this I don't mean to pick on you in any event back to Candace and her no ass the reason why that comment got to me is that Candace my beautiful wife is human and has flaws just like the rest of us she has myriad imperfections one of them though is not having an ass if there's one thing that girl definitely has it's a great question that I really liked is how have haters contributed to my success you know I think every time somebody puts you down it makes you want to push harder to go back up I can remember dropping out of high school to get a job to support my baby and get us off of welfare and like my friend's parents didn't want their friends to hang out with me anymore because I was like a bonafide loser and bad influence so certainly the harder I work and the more success I find in life the easier it is for me to come to terms with that this is one of my favorites chelsea peretti tweeted this haters are going to hate creators are going to create and that's probably one of the biggest frustrations of being creator on YouTube is that like we're the ones doing the work you're just some typing in the comments like well you're sitting there late at night in your underwear spreading hate across YouTube we're up working we're working really hard to make things to put out there to share ideas and share our perspectives and you're just some dope just some skin dope sitting there putting other people down hating is really easy creating is really hard alright I want to pull all this together one of my all-time favorite quotes this is by this is by the guy that wrote the book or the movie Fight Club happiness is the best revenge nothing drives people crazy ER than seeing someone have a good life and you know what that's the truth jealousy and envy that's behind most haters they want what you have they can't have it so they hate on you the more good you have the more they hate on you the more they push you down some thoughts in general give people the benefit of the doubt assume that they're being good assume that they're being positive it makes you vulnerable and every once in a while you will be proven wrong and you'll feel like a jerk because somebody who you thought was good turned out to be an but the truth is the alternative is to be a negative skeptical cynical person and there's enough cynicism in this world I give everyone the benefit of the doubt I always assume the best when sometimes I'm wrong and that makes me feel like a jerk but I deal with it because it's a very small price to pay so I want to end this by saying something I've said before which is ignore the haters ignore them because they don't matter they're small weak feeble people who are unhappy they're deeply unhappy they're hurt deep down they're hurt and hurt people hurt people when you're hurt you spread the hurt and that's what they're doing the next time you're being bullied the next time you're the recipient of a haters negativity know this their punishment is their life something my brother used to say know that while they might be picking on you with a smile on their face writing that comment the snow you look on their face when they lay in bed at night they're not happy they don't feel good about themselves they're weak scared little people terrified about what tomorrow might bring okay this concludes this week's talk about haters I hope that wasn't too negative for you I just thought I would speak a little truth today um and I should say that there was like no specific event that made me think that maybe I should talk about haters today just a general kind of thing it's something I see really often being in the public eye cuz I share so much on YouTube and if I see it that means some of you probably see it and it's good to address these things so you know how I feel about this kind of negativity I'm going home somebody's smoking pot in this building she's excited hello hi what's up you guys should follow me on being my user name is Christian for Christian for the number 4 because um because why cuz beam is cool I throw the cool people hang speed means the best yeah best it is like 10 p.m. I'm on a train right now I shot an amazing vlog today so just looking at the footage I have no audio for a lot of it it's probably my fault although I don't understand why this camera doesn't have audio level while your report is infuriating so today's vlog is gonna feel super montage me I'm sorry where I can find audio in there the not it's such a good blog too filled with adventure and family wonderment and all kinds of other awesome adjectives miles you oh okay super early paddleboard ride here where should we go the lighthouse have you been to lighthouse that's just a you faked all right let's do it we're gonna go there Brady is still out there gotta respect that so there's a really nasty crosswind coming out so we're anticipating it being worse on the way back what that means is when you're on the paddleboard and there's a crosswind or waves from the side it throws you in the worst way the most jarring way possible and that's what it is the entire way back which is from where we are right now all the way to that shoreline that you can barely see out there here listen to this wind ready that's what we're about to paddle into you I just fell in oh it's not a big deal it's just really jarring these ways is he from the side and it threw me in the water and I'm soaked Brady's back alright yeah nice job man I fell in did you see me yeah we're going fun

mom's my googa we're still going to go to my dad's coffee shop so he can see the baby because we're good children part of the trouble with my dad's coffee shop is that it's a little too successful

what do you think beam will be available for Android I wish I could say days it's going to be months we are working on it right now believe me I want it in the hands of Android users as soon as possible if there is a way to do it faster we'd be doing that oh I like this question if you were president what would you change that DMV why the DMV isn't completely computerized and seamless is beyond me that's what I would change if I were president the Department of Motor Vehicles are you planning on making any longer movies in the vlogs in the near future not really kind of like this whole vlog thing I have a couple like three movies that not movies just like pile of footage I've been sitting on for a while that I really want to shape into something but I kind of like the bandwidth right now to do that how do you find all this great music people send me all the music that I use and that's no joke a bunch of really amazing musicians and composers Gina Gina I remember you from our Meetup how was LA and will we be seeing Francine and Gigi anytime soon la was amazing albeit slightly overwhelming but a really incredible experience Frannie and Gigi will be back on the vlog I just like it's sometimes hard bringing the vlog into my home I like it I love seeing it on there but when I'm home sometimes I just want to be home without the camera so when you don't see Candace or Frannie or Gigi know the reason why is just that I don't know I guess I just want to be a hundred percent present when I'm with the fam it's not always sometimes I like to share it's weird what would you do with Donald Trump's hair if it were to fall into your hands I would go like that and then I would wash my hand how relieved were you when Bheem launched I wasn't relieved at all that was like this after having my kids the scariest day of my life was launching bean Carter wants to know a favorite part about VidCon favorite part about VidCon when I release these movies I literally just click upload the next day I'll see like a view count but it's just a number it's abstract and what was so wonderful about VidCon is literally like meeting all the people that actually see my move he's like putting a face to that getting to shake their hands or give them a hug or take a picture with them I hope they count invites me back in years to come Shane wants to know how much do you love Ben Brown I love Ben brown so much then is a good friend of mine if you guys don't know about him I'll link his blog below go check him out he's a daily vlogger he's an adventurer he's just an awesome guy he's a dear friend I loved hanging out with him at VidCon that was like my second favorite part of it do you ever get burnt out from doing a vlog every day yes I get burnt out from being a vlog every day every day the pivot or an inflection point from that burnout happens every morning when I click upload and that like sensation that sense of accomplishment is so addictive that it drives me through the next day of burnout and then I upload again and this is the virtuous cycle that is daily vlogging Joanne asks do you ever sleep in the truth is no I post these vlogs every morning at 8 a.m. which precludes me from ever sleeping in the scan cludes today's QA I just lifted my monitor here in a much darker now than it was at the start of the QA see this situation here these are my windows and when I start QA these windows like the Sun is coming through and I just finished and the Sun is pretty diminished that's why I'm sort of darker now than it was when I started walking home really wish I was riding the boosted board home today was too fast do you have a new toy is it a gigantic stick daddy will be right back going to get the car Saturday morning tradition on the skateboard headed to go pick up the car from the garage this is my favorite skateboard ride of the week because there's never any cars at 7 a.m. on a Saturday except for these cars where's the car where's the car what are the guys no one in there I'd get the car myself but in New York City they keep your car on these like car elevators and they have to take the car down from the out I think

scale so you could get an idea how big that is it's got to be like 6 feet tall it is enormous it's the size of like a dolphins do these like these reptilian marks oh it's terrible looking no two ways about it that is definitely a sea monster it's disgusting it smells terrible I really know what I was thinking but I agreed to go run with my brother and my friend in Central Park this morning so I'm headed up there now but Central Park is really far from here so it's like a four or five mile run to get to where I'm meeting them to start our run at Central Park they're really really late supposed

miles 16.2 at an 804 pace kind of hurt this morning Julia Candice riding this thing in the street is just impossibly dangerous it's so fast way faster than have any business being question answers time okay first I just want to apologize ahead of time if the like noise that's happening during this Q&amp;A is particularly egregious there's construction happening that way construction over there construction on the other side of this wall construction in the hallway first question Casey why do you think you're ready to leave New York City answer I literally and going crazy because of the noise pollution in this town there is no escape from it and since they started shooting these vlogs from like filming everything all the time it really just drives home how like pervasive this incessant noise pollution is okay first question that's not asked by me Casey what's the worst purchase you've ever made and why this thing because I will break a hip on it okay Dalton wants to know is your app going to be free of course it is Carlos asks what makes you proud of yourself okay that's a weird way to phrase it but how I have confidence in Who I am and the decisions I make is that I have this moral compass in life and it is like it is a summation or an amalgam of everything that I believe in everything that I think is right and fair and just in every decision that I make personal private business every decision that I make is made through the looking-glass the perspective of my moral compass of what I believe is right and what I believe is wrong and if it's wrong I don't make that decision I only make decisions that I believe in and the aggregate of that you do that over enough time and it gives you a sense of pride it gives you a sense of confidence in in what you've done in life Eli wants to know how has vlogging helped you as a filmmaker anyone that works in any creative field knows that when there's no impetus to create it's very hard to make something meaning like without a deadline it's hard to actually finish like that awesome platitude that I love to preach without a goal you can't score so how logging has helped me as a filmmaker it's forced me to make a new movie every day and by doing that my skills have improved by editing is improved my confidence in my editing has improved everything has been moved forward because of this law because of this like self-imposed daily deadlines what is the hardest thing to learn how to do or master when you start filmmaking how to tell a story it's also the only thing that matters when you're making a movie is can you or can you not tell a story if you can tell a great story people will forgive everything bad cinematography bad sound bad everything people will forgive that if the story is great adversely if the story's weak or the story is not there it doesn't matter how pretty it is it doesn't matter how much money you spent on the fanciest it no one gives a story is king everything else is slaved to story Wouter wants to know do you ever critique your own work you know honestly after I post these things I never watch them so I don't know I try to look forward do you regret dropping out of high school ah that's a tough one regret no um I dropped out of high school because I had no other option I had to get a job I had to work I had to make a living to support my child there were no other options I couldn't move in with my parents my parents didn't have any money I literally had nowhere else to turn so I had to become an adult right then and there so regret is like a not a fair classification of it I would have loved to have continued my education but I had no other choice every step every turn every inflection point in my life has made me who I am today and I'm very happy I would be very happy life so it's hard for me to look back and regret any decisions so do I regret it no what I recommend it absolutely not stay in school don't do drugs Carlos what's the meaning of life Carlos existentialism is a very dangerous thing ignore it get back to work do you ever get camera shy no Ethan can you speak other languages ah beyond Susie Paul say hey beyond just kidding no why do you have a gay flag on your desk well I have this pride flag as a way of saying hello and welcome to my LGBT viewers hello and welcome okay I think I'm going to end today's Q&amp;A they're just ducking out of the office now I had to leave the little segue thing behind my ankles were starting to hurt I'm on skateboard trying to go to the gym these kids started screaming my name what's up guys I can walk maybe you'll make my vlog I think the saying is if you don't show up for work on Saturday don't bother showing up for work on Monday but I prefer it if you don't show up for work on Saturday don't bother showing up for work on Sunday sunday is by far my favorite day in the office it's the one day of the week where the bloodsuckers and meddlers and time wasters aren't in their offices emailing and calling you and wasting your time it's the one day of the week where you can really get work done still hate going to JIT so I don't the gym check out the time that's funny Oh the place is called baked get baked for Easter yeah clever do you mind if I go to work today for a couple of hours this is that day headed to the office this is much less of a running into take care of something Matt and I had scheduled to come in today to catch up on a few things weren't able to get to on Friday yo how's the weekend yeah it's true any better somewhere they take your cell phone at some point in time only when you're going to get selected so yeah I feel like basically I'm just like we have people coming in a week and it's whatever right you'd enjoy the remaining hours of your weekend see you tomorrow morning oh yeah good luck at Jerry duty today's like the first truly warm spring day really excited to get out there on my bike all right I think I'm gonna head over to the West Side Highway do a little tour of my favorite New York City views I would describe my affection for the city borderline unhealthy as told by my three cameras that are currently taking pictures of a city I've lived in for the last 14 years camera one is right there camera two is right there and then if you look right here you see the third camera I can't resist taking pictures of this city it's like being around a very attractive lady we just want to preserve it or a very attractive guy you know whatever you're into never being a bicycle unattended in New York City this is Battery Park City probably my favorite view of the Empire State Building it's right there here look ah there's the shot of the One World Trade Center that we wanted to get for a while but yet to be able to get maybe today are more conducive God that building is enormous I do a lot of setting my camera up and then walking away from it if I go on the shots were walking through frame everybody keeps asking in the comments if I've ever had a camera stolen and the answer is no if I ever were to have a camera stolen it would be today so I have this one all the way over there and then I have my big 5d Mark 3 here I also have a bag full of lenses right there an unlocked bike there with a GoPro on it there and then I have my iPhone stuck in this chain link fence there so my final stop of the day in an end to a glorious weekend is the pier on what is this 42nd Street that's the intrepid that gigantic aircraft carrier there okay just met some kid who came to say hi and I ganked his electric skateboard this

and I have an early morning meeting at the usual spot good morning Matt all right bit of a situation today see I have a job and that job is running a technology company called beam throughout my day and my responsibilities at that job I pull aside like time and little experiences and that is what makes up this vlog but there are some days like today where I'm not sure how to do that let me let me show you my schedule for today here's my schedule well that's a piece of paper at 5:00 a.m. I wake up from 5:00 to 7:00 I edit my blog 7:00 to 7:30 s baby stuff 7:30 d15 was a quick run at 8:30 I had

finish tomorrow's vlog now see I can edit in the middle of the night and I usually do but I can't actually shoot the vlog in the middle of the night and when my days as packed as today is when am I supposed to shoot the vlog so I have an idea my idea goes like this I've been sitting on this footage this little movie I shot a long time ago called snow day and I'm going to make today's vlog the movie snow day that way I don't have to actually shoot anything I can just use this footage here I can edit in the middle of the night and it's still like an exciting fun thing okay so here is my short movie called snow day snowplows are out trying to keep up with the latest winter storm dumping more than a foot of snow on many areas of the East Coast by tonight you ready to go I've got it over in canvas yeah well let's go to the park I'll meet you downstairs you that's kind of fun right check this guy out total boss I had like two drinks last night which is fine but then I ran eight

with my new company consulting for my new company and he's in Midtown now I'm gonna go meet him we're gonna go camera shopping also I don't know if I'd been totally clear about this in the vlog yet but I want to go on record as saying these things are insanely dangerous they're not safe they're easy to ride but they're not safe at all I fell earlier today and I've been really limping ever since got my bike told Ryan I'd be up there in about 15 minutes I think I'll be there in about 12 what are all these people lined up for Oh Lulu did a recreation of the Seinfeld set to promote something or another these people are all aligned to go see it that's crazy New York City what is up of these roads so I'm meeting Ryan at one of my favorite stores in all of New York City a story I don't go to often I never make it up to this part of town see I'm really unhappy with my current camera ear my vlogging setup it's just like not right and I want to explore the options I have so this place B&amp;H it's probably like the best camera store here in the city no way me Club I was like that guy looks familiar here shopping there huh what's the OCD here I'm meeting a friend here yeah this is me Slav you might remember him from other vlogs he's not the friend I'm here to meet why are you here shopping nice laughs nice to meet you too see you later good luck with your Red Bull movie soon

started just five my flight as soon cuz next I would have gotten into plane takes off in like 40 minutes leaving the lounge now solo thank you funny I always thought I had a really good relationship with American Airlines yet I was not invited to the party here we go my thank you literally the only reason why I brought my penny board in addition to my boosted board is so I could ride it in the airport security oh look the other way with this little thing that was on my huge motorized skateboard they would definitely freaked out for this floor taking off now if one stopped Miami then we go

outside my door is like this popping nightclub filled up with like really attractive women not that that even matters to me or that I even care about that happen off down there all right thus concludes my trip to Mexico thanks for coming with me hi this is Steph gravettian on beam watch me put post-its on things on being hmm by me alone per run bye bye have a good breakfast today is the greatest day of the week Monday check this out I just passed 1 million subscribers so I spent a lot of time thinking about what I wanted to talk about what I wanted to do for my one millionth subscriber YouTube video I want to make a video about why why make Internet videos it's something I have some strong opinions about that's mainstream that's mainstream that's mainstream to mainstream see that that's mainstream mainstream I wanna see some really old stuff look at this that's when they need me I was in the Beautiful People issue look how beautiful that's my brother he's way prettier than me television movie theaters feature films film festivals all that represents is like a level of success and what would be described as the mainstream media the Internet has been seen as a stepping-stone like part of the route to get you to mainstream media if you do well here maybe you can get to TV maybe you can make a movie that goes into a film festival that's what I take issue with I disagree with that I think YouTube I think the Internet I think that is mainstream I think it is the maximum degree of relevance when it comes to media YouTube is mainstream it's not a stepping stone it's the finish line let me explain all right we'll get out your whoa I'm gonna have to go to the overhead shooting table for this one see historically filmmaking has always been an elitist artform here's what I mean if you want to be a painter you need a brush and paint if you want to be a writer you need a pen and paper but if you wanted to be a filmmaker you needed cameras and film and lenses and gear and people and actors and money and connections and distribution you needed to know important people it's never been an accessible means of self-expression but technology change that the beauty of putting movies on the Internet is it's it's democratic its egalitarian and most importantly it's a meritocracy and what that means is if your videos have an audience if the work you're making is interesting to anyone that anyone those people can find it so all you have to be concerned with is making something that someone else wants to watch you know that old saying it's not what you know but who you know my favorite part of YouTube is that no one gives issue you know they just care whether they like it or they don't and the reason why I shifted from mainstream I'm all those accolades I showed you earlier to the Internet is because of this there's me and there's the audience and what I decide my video is done I click upload and distribute it to the world and whoever wants to see it can see it it's taking us that's you and me to a place of true self-expression that is when you have an idea when you have something to say you can say it and you can say to everyone in the world and you can do it without needing anyone else without needing any resources outside of your reach zooming it for dramatic effect that's why I say vlogging is my favorite film genre the societal and cultural impacts of this are unknown but if you take one little glimpse at where they're headed it matters that's why 1 million people choosing to subscribe to see my content on the Internet is more important to me than any of those mainstream accolades and lastly to round this out why have I shifted and committed so much of mine and committed so much of my life to building a platform being where people can share their own self-expression is because the true goal with being the ambition with being is to do everything I just described but to remove the aspect that is creation right now you have to they creative expression and our goal or manifesto at bean is to remove that need of creation and just have it be about sharing that's why there's no review or preview or any of that that's it this video I didn't want this video to come across as like me shilling theme but I wanted to tie it all together and share with you my audience why I'm so passionate about what I do online what I do with these vlogs and definitely what I do at beam ok thanks for the subscribe see you at 2 million so your cue is right when the noise starts okay great yeah fun balloons here this rather scary-looking dog in here welcome to Brooklyn it's early in the morning I'm on my bike riding through traffic I'm headed to Brooklyn I'm going to Brooklyn to do a little video collaboration with my friends Sh'ma Yoho you definitely know them they made this video he's climbing in your windows he's snatchin your people up tryna rape em so I got a sour as a cheese pad you're wise we're doing a little like singsong collaboration today whoa I don't know that way around Brooklyn at all I'm sure I can figure this out what he's here yes so this is just like your production EQ yes well man this is where we have our modest amount of gear to do recording stuff obviously most of our music and stuff is sequenced shoot green-screen in here as you can see chill zone in there sometimes we make the interns work back there this is the bathroom back here that's where people peepee and that's the end of the tour we done gone quiet on hazy as you to hide your wife hide your kids hide your wife hide your kids hide your wife all right so what I'm doing here these guys were making a song now I'm gonna be singing it I'm not much of a singer but I'm excited about this would you rather sit or stand mmm sit feels good okay I know so let's just get this one for some beers perhaps inside lining up my wow so this is a song we just record hey you can tell us Casey's voice that looks exactly like his voice doesn't it yeah I'm not gonna toot my own horn but I am a bit of a songbird yeah I mean I mean that that's why we labeled them with these song birds right here walk into the dorms excuse me yeah I need a large family coming awesome shoot guys thank you for having me it's an absolute pleasure all right I'll see you guys later that was super fun with those guys it lasts a little longer than I had expected but I was having so much fun I didn't want to stop all right I got to get back now because it's time for Q&amp;A okay let's get started would you skydive yeah I've been skydiving quite a few times in this video you can see me skydiving in Israel which is a pretty amazing place to go skydiving also I took Owen skydiving also in Israel when he was like 12 or 13 years old which is pretty special how did you in Kandice me uh that's a great question we met really we met for the first time at a bar mitzvah and it was out of town she invited me to stay at her parents house and I just like spent the entire weekend relentlessly trying to hook up with her she wouldn't have it one morning I even woke up sleeping in the dog's bed because she had kicked me out of her bed but we see who had the last laugh there Jakub asks who has influenced your life the most someone you know personally that would be Owen my son I credit kind of everything I've done to him and I don't think I'd have been able to do really anything that I would call a success in life without without Owen so that's an easy one what do you enjoy most about work for me work is is about being productive it's about doing something that sense of accomplishment of that sense of productivity is what I enjoy most about work and to me like work and life are one in the same so all of those values hold true when thinking about life in general do you plan on traveling soon I'll be in Los Angeles on Monday how did you first meet Karlie Kloss Carly came to an event I was doing where I was premiering a movie that I'd made and I don't know who brought her but we met then and have been good friends ever since Carly is a very easy person to be friends with do you get along with Owens mom yeah we've been very very close his whole life how can I promote my YouTube videos to reach new subscribers you know there's no secret trick to growing a YouTube channel and this is like advice that no one likes hearing but if you make great content you will find your audience there's not much more to it than that you can hack it you can try to trick it and you might get a little bit of followers but if you want followers that actually care people watching your content that actually give a about it then it's about making content that people care about how do you manage being so optimistic about everything what's the alternative to be negative or cynical there's more than enough negativity in this world and negativity doesn't feel good negativity is just easy so if you put in the time to work hard at being positive and being optimistic it's a much better life but it does take more work negative people are typically lazy people how long does it take you to edit your vlogs like four to seven hours fastest and being like for like the more complicated ones take like seven Jacob asks have you ever thought about giving up do you ever want an extra hour of sleep yes I always want an extra hour of sleep what kind of a sicko doesn't want more sleep okay that flash this camera is on manual focus and it's on manual exposure and manual ISO it should not be flashing like that it shouldn't be adjusting to anything look I feel like I'm always bashing Canon cameras but the truth is like this is a Canon that's what I'm shooting on these things give me so much trouble Canon why why is it flashing right now it's on manual setting see manual ah I'm ending the Q&amp;A there thank you for joining me this week more to your days next Tuesday guys I'll see you tomorrow yeah excuse me folks so last night I didn't get home till 2:00 a.m. feel pretty good about tonight like 7:30 going home at a reasonable hour like a reasonable human being you know here's the East Coast feed champion when he was 13 today's Monday my favorite day of the week big day today I feel like I said it every day but every day is a big day psyched to be back in the office after that weekend of leisure and I'm here I don't think I remember but a second one of these was ordered on Friday night mail time thank you oh man I love these things thank you for sending me more because we eat them all this is not as paid I mean I got these for free but I wasn't paid to him I just like these kind of fruit roll-ups power inverters Thank You energizer for the power inverters I needed them and I appreciate it but I don't want you to think for one second that I don't already have power inverter Z's are in the central part of anyone's car I don't think there was a letter in there but whoever sent me the booze thank you Charlie's box college yeah this is a lock-picking kit and a lock-picking practice kit it's like a criminal workshop somebody sent me now there's a letter Bryan black thank you for all this stuff there's a lot going on in this office but one thing that's not going on here are any plants being grown or herbs so thank you whoever sent this to me or the plants so after I have all this fun opening up all these boxes I then spent like an hour cleaning up my own mess I always get a lot of requests to do like a behind-the-scenes of this vlog which I'm not so sure I understand because it's a vlog there are no scenes by virtue of it being a vlog everything's kind of behind the scenes so I'm not sure what you're asking for when you ask for behind the scenes but it's Monday so I thought I would show some of the mechanics of how I make the vlog I don't have anything else to talk about today so this is like filler this is a filler vlog okay but even over this before but this is my main camera here this is a Canon Rebel I used to have a 70d but that camera but this camera broke anyways so now I use now I'm using this thing this Canon Rebel mm for the price I guess it's okay this is the camera that I try to use for all of my shooting because it looks good this directional mic up here is pretty good I use like this selfie stick apparatus so it's not all up in my face like this see that drifting focus that's this camera the other one was a little bit better I can't always carry around with me this huge somewhat ridiculous camera rig like if you think it'd be like a gangster who carries around a tommy gun that's the big camera but you have to have your sidearm to at the ready at all time so I always have a camera at the ready to and basically it's like if the shots are premeditated meaning I considered shooting them before I actually shot them they go on this big pretty camera if they're super spontaneous they're on this little camera so some things that I haven't done before from a narrative perspective I try to cut out like a small piece of my day and find a story and I make that story sort of the like the under underlying theme of that day's vlog if there's like a nugget of the day where I'm doing something that's not me sitting at my desk or having meetings I try to make a vlog about that usually I've done like zero editing by the time I get home if I'm lucky I'll find like 20 minutes throughout the day to actually import the footage I get almost like 7:30 hanging around the baby hanging around Candice by 8:30 or 9:00 I sit down to edit I edit using this train wreck of a software here it's called Final Cut Pro X it really is not great software there are a number of better options I'm just unwilling to take the time to learn something better what makes it easier to vlog every day is if you have some sort of a format mine is very loose at best I always have a time lapse at the beginning I always have an abrupt ending so I find that to be like really satisfying to watch besides that my format is extremely loose and my goal with this vlog isn't and it has never been to like share all the intimacy's of my life it's always just been to create a good or entertaining piece of content every day Hofstra was an all-american skier this is his first time on the Skyrim Marathon we know practice in like three hours it goes toes forward that's it that's so funny hang on a second okay this is a trick that I can do I'm the only person that can do it and Oscar is about to try it it's the 180 if you twist it all when you take off that's right nice touch answer yeah thanks pretty rugged man right kid I gotta get back to it good to see you are you leaving tomorrow yeah I wanna have fun in Italy all right nice wrapper this step is going down just met a nice man young man named Alex so I can see right there Alex I'm sorry I couldn't spend more time talking to you if I did I wouldn't get to see the baby tonight and seem nice but you know she's my baby she's awake she's awake good night that gentleman seems very upset two things you need to know first thing today is beamed it what that means is today is the day that beam launched now you're seeing this tomorrow so tomorrow will mean that yesterday was beam day but tomorrow's yesterday is today and today is beam day and beam day is crazy nuts the second thing you need to know I didn't sleep at all last night I laid down in the office for like 15 minutes at 5:00 a.m. so I'm a little bit loopy today so if I don't make any sense in today's vlog just know it's like because of total exhaustion I'm not on drugs or anything I just like it's been so long since I've slept we got a lot of visitors the office day we got kids waiting outside with balloons beam day is a crazy day crazy what's going on out there there's a lot of people outside what are you guys doing down there these are now in the bar I'm coming down it's beam day I've got a whole cacophony of things to talk about regarding beam before I do during last week's mail time I said something to the effect of whenever I open up mail tine boxes I get scared that there's going to be a human head inside that was a joke I just want to say to whatever wiseass sent me this today you totally freaked me out this is as far as I get okay and then I open this up look try to tell me this wouldn't freak you out okay what does that look like in there okay then you pull it away what does that look like that's red and then it's like sticky and biological looking and it's shaped like a skull this is a human head made out of like gummy bear material this is disgusting and you completely freaked me out when I opened it very funny please no one else send me human heads what I can do fueled gross on today's program we're going to cover three things all pertaining to bean number number one Pro tips number two whoo number number two who to follow and number three we're gonna do like a short Q&amp;A yesterday I should I use it like this and that does work really well but you don't have to hold it against your chest see it just works off this sensor up here that you can really see on a white phone like see that dot the little one right above that your whole thing that dot right there is the sensor cover that and it starts recorded so what that means is like you can definitely just go like this and it records or if you want to talk to the camera and you like this and then talk to the camera beam isn't just about holding your phone against your chest the principle behind that is it's about not looking at your phone while you capture and if you're holding it up like this and the screens black there's not a whole lot to look at you're not interrupting the moment for the phone with that there's some fun stuff you can do okay this is my favorite thing to do while I'm riding my bicycle or I'm on a skateboard ready because it like captures exactly what I'm looking at and because I'm holding it to my face it picks up your voice really well so it's great for narration you do kind of look like a knuckle and holding your phone like this though now each clip is four seconds long only four seconds long if you pull it away before four seconds it cancels the post but your beam can be as long as you want it to be if you want it to be longer just keep capturing more clips when it comes to sending reactions it's really fun to send a whole bunch of them so one thing I like to do while I'm watching somebody's beam is just to keep reacting and move my head slightly like this or spin around slightly and then when the person's looking at my reactions if they tap fast enough it almost looks like a stop frame movie okay I think that's it for pro tips next up who to follow beam's brand new so most users have no idea how to use the platform or how to do really interesting things on it yet but there are a couple of people that have been on our beta for a lot that have really found their voice so here are three recommends number one is my friend Ben Brown his user name is Ben that's a ridiculously good user name I highly recommend you check out then because ven lives in South Africa he's always traveling like the last week all of his beans were from Zambia and like the Zambezi River he's like a really positive guy who is always on an adventure so I would check out Ben next up is my friend Sean Duras it's like the country Honduras and the name Sean combined Sean Duras Sean is just like he's one of the happiest most lovely human beings I've ever met on be neat l's he's like really amazing almost like intimate little stories from his life like yesterday he almost missed his airplane and his whole beam was about racing to the airport and like it started in an uber on his way to the airport and the beam ended literally in the cockpit of the plane so definitely check out Sean Duras Sean just posted let's let's check out one of his beams about rob a bank dead serious all right the last person that I want to recommend his name is Harris now Harris is like a young guy he lives here in New York City and he does things on being that I didn't think you could do he has shirts and he keeps his phone in his Harris also Ament 'add a couple of really weird techniques like he built this like hand strap for his phone so record like that and he had one thing that I love he takes his phone and he tucks it into his belt so it looks like this and then he can record hands-free he just has a bunch of really weird really awesome things on theme' so definitely check out Harris section 3 which is Q&amp;A now normally I do my Q&amp;A is by going on Twitter or sending ask me questions but all I've been getting all day are questions about beam so thank you guys for the number one question I've been getting is is beam going to be on Android and the answer is yes 100% I do carry an Android phone in addition to my iPhone so one will it be available on Android soon will have an app on Android where you can reserve your name and we're going to release that before release the full app on Android cuz that's going to take longer but it's happening and it's not like a year away it's happening it's going to happen like as soon as possible we really wanted on Android our mission here the the principle that all of our decisions that beam revolve around the goal that we're trying to accomplish is to promote empathy by sharing perspective and what that means is if you can see the world from everyone's perspective you'll better understand who other people are and how they live and limiting that to one ecosystem really limits the effectiveness of a platform like being hell yeah free M&amp;Ms Thank You oh I get I just did thank you for my M&amp;Ms really excited to be getting out of the office early I didn't really get to see Francine yesterday so I'm making sure I'm home in time tonight to give her a bath and put her

jail mom I have a baby is pouring rain outside and I'm soaked so I have one solution for that this heat gun is made for stripping paint it will give you third-degree burns all over your body but if

I'd love to buy you a beer and that's very sweet it's it's very appreciated and extremely flattering I thrive on the constant stress that is having more things that I need to do then I have time to do them I always keep a backlog of things that I need to do just in case I have a free moment so I can do that I never want free time free time is the enemy of progress I hope that doesn't make me sound crazy Gigi gonna go for a walk TV you want to go for a walk you want read Gigi come on no pooping the homework blocking a dog in Manhattan with no leash is both against the law and grossly

home shower dress work I slept nine hours last night that was coming off of a 48-hour no sleep bender I feel like a completely different person today it's like I'm on drugs great way to start the week today is Monday so I wanted to spend today's vlog doing another behind the scenes and that's where I like break down an old movie I had made and tell the stories about like how it came to be and what happened behind it but I was looking through my archives here trying to find some footage to support the behind the scenes that I wanted to do today and I found something that's really awesome it stars a very drunk Candice my now wife who 10 years ago was just some baby I was not a hot date with and it's at like 4:00 in the morning and we're leaving a bar or something I don't remember what had happened was my older brother vans bike had been stolen a few days earlier we're in the same neighborhood which is Alphabet City I saw these like four dudes leaning up against the wall hanging out and they had vans bike so I gave Candace my camera I gave her my backpack and I remember saying to her whatever happens do not try to help me just call the police if this shit goes down what happened and she didn't do a very good job of capturing this because she was busy filming herself what happened is I just rolled up on these four guys and they're like big thugs and I was like a 24 year old and I just like I remember like being like blind confidence Casey overwhelm them with confidence make these four dudes fear you and I just like rolled up fists clenched and like stared into their eyes like like glaring eye contact and then I grabbed the bike put it on my shoulder never broke eye contact and walked away okay here's the video that he saw vans bike vans bike got stolen last night everything she sees it are you fucking kidding me he's got it it's like is that how do you know it is about the license plate yep that's that's vans bike all right back to behind the scenes which I am totally pumped to do today today's gonna be an awesome behind-the-scenes because these are kind of stories I've never told before this behind the scenes is going to be about a campaign I did which was three four four four separate videos I did for Mercedes Benz was I want to say this was I want to say like 2014 2013 okay let me just put a better lens on there the mercedes-benz CLA project was a advertising campaign about this car which is the mercedes-benz CLA I got this campaign with them and it was to make four videos so there was never any storyboards and he script any outlines there was nothing specific it was all kept incredibly broad which was a really big deal for me especially then because I didn't have the audience then that I have now this was by far the biggest dollar ad campaign I'd ever done it was enough money to enable us to do whatever we wanted to do like no matter how crazy the idea we would have the budget for it the first part this video here this is like a little background why I like mercedes-benz I happen to drive a Mercedes at the time I did this campaign my history with them cool little video shot most of it here in the studio and it ended on a really kick-ass note which was them dropping off a prototype CLA so we were like the first people to have one okay whatever Chrissa part to austria and i oscars like my best friend he's also like a producer and a film maker so Oscar and I traveled to Germany and all we brought with us was like skateboards and a couple cameras and we went to the mercedes-benz museum and we went to like their car Factory and we have to drive all kinds of like crazy souped-up prototypes okay part three this is by far my favorite video of the four video campaign it's playing here the narrative of this video goes like this it shows us starting to do the shoot in New York City with this beautiful girl and then it starts to pour out so we shift gears and we fly to the Bonneville Salt Flats in New Mexico Arizona New Mexico Nevada that's not how it went down what actually happened this is where it gets fun is we went to the Bonneville Salt Flats first and we had this whole enormous shoot scheduled and organized for out there we had a helicopter an airplane for stunt cars we had stunt drivers but it was all predicated on the fact that we had a beautiful functioning mercedes-benz CLA to shoot so we went out the night before the shoot to do some testing and I like I wrecked the car know that this was like a handmade prototype that was just made to be like pushed out in a showroom floors wearing white gloves it was not even really meant to be driven we had to cancel the entire shoot the next day and we basically left with what was like a garbage pile of footage and we looked at that footage and we're like this isn't we don't have a movie there's not enough here so that was what I was like okay we need to do another shoot and Mercedes was super super cool they got us another car and then we did the second part of the shoot in New York City they wanted something authentic and real and something that felt true not manufactured so the only way yeren t that was to constantly put us in harm's way where things would definitely go wrong and then whatever the outcome of that was would be our video and that was sort of the thesis behind the campaign and everything else I did prosecute today I'm doing behind the scenes of the CLA project alright what detail did I leave out did you talk about what and I talked about how we broke the car yeah I miss all flaps the car was destroyed on my birthday biggest production nightmare I've ever had to deal with I was trying to have fun and everything that we planned out went to shit immediately miss Casey destroyed the car notice him it wasn't anybody else don't let him just don't say anything I completely wrecked the car and hospira had to deal with all the river cut he was doing all the hard work and all I was doing was screwing it up and it was my birthday hey Desiree Thanks later that video turned out being my favorite it was the most accidental which made it the most real which made it just amazing video for was the actual commercial it's one minute long so it could actually go on TV and you can click and watch it here I worked with my friend Gabe who's like a really smart writer and I was like Gabe I just want there to be like a single message here to encapsulate all the ethos behind this entire project that we did which i think is in line with the ethos behind the actual car that Mercedes is trying to sell sometimes in life you just have to say yeah and we literally made the commercial that says sometimes in life you just have to say okay and now I knew that couldn't be shown on TV I still showed it's Mercedes though so we ended up saying sometimes in life you just have to say yes which is probably even better because it's like more positive and people could misconstrue what bucket actually means that's it oh one more interesting tidbit this literally hurts my beings to admit this so I'm gonna zoom in to make it even more serious so for the last video I knew it was gonna be more of like a crazy music video montage situation then like a real narrative so the song was everything now this is like three years ago but I just learned about this like Australian girl rapper named Iggy Azalea I wanted her to play the babe like driving the car on me and the car behind it and I wanted to use her song work now we happen to have like the same agent represents us or same agency or whatever so where was he get in touch with her and she was totally down to do it for a fee that was completely reasonable its to hire her now be millions and millions and millions of dollars but nobody knew she was then and mercedes-benz said no they didn't think she was gonna be a big deal and they thought that she might be a liability unbelievable anyways okay all right that's my behind the scenes at the mercedes-benz CLA project links to all those movies below just quick disclaimer Mercedes Benz doesn't know that I made this behind-the-scenes or that I was disclosing this information on my youtube channel so none of this is endorsed I love they would be mad at me for sending any of this stuff but I will say though that working with them was really super awesome okay that's it please excuse this

yeah I think it melted just so you know that little intro sequence there I both flooded my downstairs neighbor that was an accident and I also filled up the entire hallway of this building with smoke also an accident alright let's get serious if you reflect back to 100 blogs ago starting today I'm going to make a movie every day for a while anyways but until I get forward my personal goals with this were to like make a bunch of new content challenge myself bring attention to the new company and I feel like I've accomplished everything I set out to do with the vlog and a hundred just feels like such a good round number to call it so I want to announce on this hundredth log that today will not be my last vlog and I'm just gonna keep going did that kind of freak you out a little bit like I was going to stop I can't stop vlogging I'm like just getting into it okay now seriously back to the blog ah yeah anyways 100 this is vlog 100 and I wanted to do something amazing on vlog 100 which I already did that title sequence is the only amazingness that's going to take place visually in this vlog so if you tune in for fireworks and stuff that's it you can stop watching right now for those of you want to hang in there I really want to talk about something that is like deeply majorly important to me on today's vlog 500th blog spectacular will consist of me sitting here talking to the camera about ideas not doing anything extraordinary my apologies what I want to talk about today is the power of creation or what can actually be accomplished if and when you make things and I do want to throw a caveat out there that these ideas that I'm talking about this idea specifically that I'm going to do like a drawing around it's not uniquely mine this is an idea that developed with my professor at MIT a brilliant brilliant man and it's something that I've been sitting on for a while and then I've been really anxious to share and this seemed like a great time for it the power of creativity really falls into three categories three tiers if you will let's get into the creation hierarchy the creation hierarchy is an upside-down triangle so let's talk about one let's talk about here and this is to create to create it to make something make anything it's much harder than it sounds most people stop just before the process where they make something where they actually create something this here this is like the first movie that I have actual record of that I made that baby is Owen and I probably made this movie 15 and a half years ago and it's terrible it's cute but it's terrible but I did it I made it and it's the doing that's the most important part now to take that idea of making something to another level this my HBO show look at that guy that show we just made my brother and I and the guy that we worked with tomato just made it a Pheo never hired us we just made it we just created that's creating that's step one it reaches the least amount of people it's the easiest to do but it's the most important because it's the first step let's get into step two tier two is when you're creation what do you make inspires and motivates others to create it's to make work that other people see in it it compels them to make work of their own it's the people that came like that I looked up to when I was younger like the Spike Jonze and the Michelle Gondry's and the Verner Hertzog's I would look up to them and I'd be like I want to make work like that and the reason why that's tier two is because that is incredibly powerful that's because for those people the people that inspired and motivated me they make one movie and it can like move an entire generation there one creation can affect an entire group of people to create that is huge and this just leaves the third tier the final tier and the final tier lives up here because is by far the hardest to accomplish but it's the most powerful because it can affect everyone it can affect the most amount of people then that third tier is to create a tool that empowers others to create let me explain the only formal Film School like education I've ever had was using the iMovie one tutorial I think that that was the seed that was planted that has since grown to this gigantic monster of a tree that is my career without the geniuses at Apple to build that software and to have made the computer that enabled me to learn how to edit I wouldn't have liked I wouldn't have the career that I have today they built a tool that empowered me to create that is HUGE that's gigantic that's why that's why that's the top at the top of the creation hierarchy the thing that affects the most people that is the hardest thing to do now I know there was a lot of speculation online that I would reveal all the details of my new company on today's vlog and let me just be clear I can't and I'm not going to but I want to talk about it in sort of abstract terms and by the way I'm not withholding information about the new company for any other reason than there's these really stupid pain in my fucking ass bull nonsense up bull things that I'm currently dealing with and working on overcoming so I can broadly announce all the specifics around it believe me when I say I had intended on on sharing every aspect of it with you the audience weeks and weeks ago and they're just these things preventing me from doing so okay now that I got that off my chest this thing is my attempt to do my very best to accomplish this to create a tool that empowers others to create and whether it's going to work whether it's going to be used I don't know what else going to tell you about about the new company well I can tell you what it's not because I've been reading all your comments and all these like all you geniuses that know all the facts you're wrong it is not and I want to be unequivocal here it is not a vlogging app did you hear that it is not a vlogging app in fact if you're a vlogger or a filmmaker you probably won't even like it who it's for is everyone else it's for people who have ever wanted to share but couldn't figure it out and and what this thing does that we've been working the last year and a half on this incredible team we're trying to build something for everyone not for people that consider themselves creators because that would be very limited this is for this is for everyone my hope for it is that it becomes a really powerful tool that that people want to use my ambitions behind this thing are greater than anything that I've ever committed myself to okay that is my creation hierarchy stick I hope you enjoyed it there will be more vlogs in the future and they'll be serious ones like this where I get all like amped up about something that I believe in and they'll be plenty of silly blogs where I like make fun of one direction for all you teeny boppers and they'll be fun other blogs where I like hanging out Candice for all the ladies that comment below about how cool she is she is pretty cool and they'll be plenty of Owen because he's cool and he's handsome and they'll be plenty of Francine because that is like the crutch of this vlog when I think I'm failing I put Francine in and she saves the vlog and hang in there all the details around the new company will be revealed very very soon and thanks for 100 but bye guys really good to see you thank you for coming by the real treat you know those days when you just you catch yourself walking around smiling and you have to stop you're like why am i smiling today those days are the best days I wish every day were those days but it's not but today is one of those days I'm not sure why welcome to the vlog look what time it is it's 12 19 and I'm just now leaving the house this is rare for me but I'm running extremely behind today see last night was the Met Gala this big party it's like prom for adults and I didn't leave the Met Gala till 1:30 in the morning I got home at 2:00 in the morning I started editing the video for Vogue that I shot there I finished that at 6:00 in the morning and then I started editing yesterday's vlog which I finished about 15 minutes ago so I haven't slept in two days but I got all my work done two movies in 12 hours that's not bad 11 hours and I feel great eyes are a little dark though yeah it is my 12:30 meeting come yet they're on their way okay big guy bye what's happening today I don't know just a great day it is a good day hey guys by Nicole by Tim Kuhn a time QA time QA time design you will put up your tripod super fast Q&amp;A time questions questions questions how's it going Louie join me for a QA I'm gonna talk about you like you're not here ok this is Louis Cole Louis is the godfather of daily vlogging and I think I can speak for every daily vlogger on the interweb that he is a tremendous inspiration I don't know how he does it amazing content every day for the last 900 days anyways good to have you oh thanks Madalyn sir hey Musa looks me alright let's answer some questions Harry wants to know Harry wants to know do you learn more from success or failure you want to take a stab at this um yeah I'd say I think I learn more from failure I guess all of us have this need or want to succeed in some way but when you fail at something especially when it's like a dramatic fail you really makes you stop and take kind of thing like why did I feel like how can I avoid this I think that it's always the toughest times in your life that define who you are much more so than the easiest times or the best times so failures are typically some of the hardest times of your life so when I look back and I see all sort of the pivotal moments in my life it was always the struggle it was always the failure that motivated me not the like loveliness of success what's your favorite country to travel to I like I like South Africa I was gonna say South Africa cuz that's where I fell in love with my wife unanimous feign wants to know what's your favorite thing about making movies what I love about making movies is it's a way to share my perspectives and share my ideas with an audience that goes beyond the person sitting next to me and that's a really that's a really powerful thing and that is one of the biggest motivators and that is that is about that is what about moviemaking that that that I appreciate the most so here's a good one for me so it halfway through the Q&amp;A asking pretty well how the other guy oh yeah did where this is where on my vlog time sorry the trouble is vloggers so let me let me answer this one so Connor said Louis what do you admire about Casey and I'd say I love his uniqueness is creativity just that there's nothing there's nothing that I can see that he's modeled and those been inspired by a lot of different things like it's it's just constant uniqueness I feel like every time I watch one of his videos he's trying something different he's doing a different angle he's playing around with even this thing of like a split screen like I just love that I love though this by the way making Lois disappear earlier was really complicated took us like a lot of thinking to figure out how to do that yeah thank you for saying that that's good well okay here's a question I love Maddie thank you for asking how tired are you of being asked what camera you shot something with extremely tired it's the least interesting I just linked mine in every description because I'm just like look just look in the description what's the best advice you would give to someone who's worried about their future what to do after school my advice is always the same which is keep yourself extremely busy as long as you're doing something you will find your path it's when you get lazy that everything becomes cute everything becomes gray or foggy it's easier to ya on the back of that it's easier to steer something that's already moving if you're just static and stationary so to build momentum you're a poet Leah yeah Casey are you gonna ever make your hair like Louise we kind of know man I don't have a patient yeah you're like okay this is what I see bit lot of dress this is what this is fun for Casey all right let's kill it there okay wait we have something that we want to share with the audience which is that we made our friends hi hide in my office will you lock them in yeah no air conditioning it's just hot back here they're all bossy and shiny from sweat all right guys I gotta kick you out thank you for coming by it was lovely to see all of you we later in the week especially you I'll see you later this week yeah let's get together let's do it this is that daily vlogger thing again bye Larry good bye guys and there they go that's true what does he have a giant Gummer yeah why would it why wouldn't he have a gigantic teddy bear of course you have a gigantic teddy bear Jerome welcome she's gonna like yeah I think she's gonna love it okay there's a final girls waiting downstairs I promise to come say hi apparently there's a guy outside yeah who's been waiting to say hi so we're gonna go say hi dude I'm sorry you've been waiting not so long no yesterday I was waiting for like maybe an hour so I'm so sorry Jerome is coming to me Francine for the first time he brought the spare as a present for the baby alright let's boogie Jack I'll see you tomorrow don't electrocute yourself Francine who's that is that uncle Jerome you're leaving tomorrow yeah you bummed I don't want to leave friend Dina morning look at these two kind of look like 11 years this is all I ever asked for front of your fan this there's a little section it's not a mirror I think you look great bye guys have a good night come machine that pumps out Jamba Juice and this machine pumps out free chili that's everything alright this this is a theory of mine but I genuinely believe this I think you can supplement sleep with exercise what I literally mean by that is say you sleep eight hours a night if you took two of those hours and spent them exercising and only slept six hours you would be less tired and in general feel better it is just a theory though Candice is preoccupied today so I think I'm going to go for an afternoon run someone commented that the running part of my vlog is getting boring so in honor of that comment and whoever wrote it today's vlog will be dedicated in its entirety to running Sunday morning long run I'm gonna check in every couple miles what let's talk about running all right first big picture this is what matters and the body is just there to like keep this thing running the brain big picture this is the Westside Highway this is where I run almost every day it's lovely here river on that side city on that side this is the one-mile check-in and I feel great I have not always been a runner I ran cross-country in middle school when I was like 11 I didn't really start running until I was 26 27 28 28 what years so on the Westside Highway now I'm in Midtown so I'm halfway up the island where I was before this is mile number six and I feel great I didn't start running till I was 28 because when I was 26 I was told I'd never be able to run again here's what happened I do this okay so I borrowed Candace's scooter and I was driving down the street and this dude ran a red light and straight up just cremated the scooter and my leg I was in the hospital for about a week I was in surgery for like 12 hours this is my busted-up leg as soon as I got to the hospital they did drill through my leg with a drill to quickly put pressure on it put it in traction to slow the bleeding so when I was in the hospital right before they were going to release me I asked the doctor how long till I'm 100% how long till I run and I'll never forget he said to me you'll be able to chase after your kids and you'll be able to chase after a taxicab down the street but you'll never be able to run again I cannot tell you how much that freaked me out I was 26 years old and being told that I would never run again it was devastated absolutely devastating okay that's still the Westside Highway on the other end of this tunnel now I'm uptown I'm coming into the island here this is the 8-mile check-in and I feel great okay I found the footage all right so this is two years after I go to the hospital this was well here just finished my first marathon like those are my feet this is gross you get the point so my first marathon was an unmitigated disaster I really like got beat up I sat down I was walking my time was abhorrent I hate doing something and not being great at it okay this is the Upper West Side that Central Park I just ran across the Upper West Side I'm now entering Central Park mile nine check in I feel great four months later I ran my second marathon and I really got I really got it together okay this is the southernmost point in Central Park that's 59th Street this is check-in number like 10 and change and I feel great somewhere I decided that running wasn't enough and I started to really get into triathlons here's my favorite picture of myself running a triathlon just look at that intensity easternmost side of Central Park that's Fifth Avenue there mile 12 and I feel great since being told by that doctor that I'd never be able to run again I've run 22 marathons at competed in four Ironman triathlons probably a hundred other triathlons and other road races and I never looked back okay this is the northernmost tip of Central Park that is Harlem Chucky and mile 13 still feel great I made a movie a while ago for for Nike about running you should check that out I'll link it there okay now back on the Westside Highway mile 16 and I feel great I always prioritize running I would definitely love another two hours of sleep I'd love to get into work a couple hours earlier but I make it a priority this is mile 19 and I honestly I wish I had had a little bit to eat this morning reading just a sip of water before I left the house I feel like an auntie saying that so I take it back mile 19 I feel great after you run for a certain amount of time you like completely forget about your body it's in cruise control a lot of the ideas for my work and my plans for movies all of those were birthed as I was running that was 21 miles at a 754 pace but you know I ran further it's just a my tracking app crashed on me like three times I use the Nike+ running app and I do not recommend it it's a terrible app that fails on you critically when you need it the most anyways mile 21 still feel great control with burning 3000 calories first thing in the morning is it's really hard to replace those calories hi today's vlog was shot in its entirety on the new iPhone 6s in 4k resolution so be sure to click here and then click here to see what it looks like at its best every shot is in 4k shot on the iPhone including this time-lapse so we're headed to midtown now for no reason than to like take pictures of something different I don't know we've drawn a skateboard and here's Marlon Marlon we're testing out the new iPhone this is the brand new one I would be in so much trouble if somebody stole that's like pre-release iPhone 6s we got to be so many camera tests are up like perfect lighting conditions and this is not that horrible clicking sound is like some nonsense happening with whatever's going on over there for our next real world camera test I'm going to use my you stick like this I'm not actually going to take pictures and Jack's going to film me while I take selfie pictures with some of the street performers I just want to say as a disclaimer I highly recommend you do not solicit he's like costume street performers I'm just doing it because I don't know it seemed like a funny idea right yeah oh yeah okay ready hi can I have a photo how did you looking for Kate yeah that's amazing pistol clear it's like being on a strip club okay who's next in that situation I'm like this week before work the weirdest isn't it weird as they are done in New York City and then you got it okay one more no okay okay thank you girls here's some here's some dollars I was extremely uncomfortable I could say for the record I don't know that I've ever really been to a strip club but I now have blue paint on me who's next Elmo the plan was that I get my picture taken with every one of these three performers but I panic around those girls so I just wanted it to end and I gave them all of our tipping money let's get out of let's get out of here man this is freaking

has 400 lines of resolution that cellphone has 4,000 couple caveats I really don't like how narrow the lenses on an iPhone on this thing I use that this is like a wide-angle adapter it's made by a company called moment this is what they look like they make really good stuff it changes your relationship with the phone I also put a microphone on there because if you're gonna use this as like a

bedtime kid nice sunglasses where'd you get those thank you and at the corner so right there I just yeah how'd you get the white the white edges just primer not gloss and not what was on it not mad primer take care I do not know that person today's Sunday today's a super low-key day today started as family day we are spending the day as a family and we're going what are we doing we went to breakfast Candice got in a fight with these two old ladies sitting next to us Candice got in a fight with these two old ladies that were sitting there so then went for a walk in the baby fell asleep then we went to some stinky perfume store in the baby woke up got some terrible ice cream and then we took a cab home so now I'm here alone in the office on a Sunday it's nice and quiet I thought it'd be a good time to have a little one-on-one talk I want to talk about this idea I want to talk about it for a while but I get nervous that I'll come across is like didactic or preachy but the truth is when I think of the people that I've learned the most from in life it's been the folks that haven't been afraid to share their ideas therefore I shouldn't worry about being preachy and I should just speak I should just share this idea is more of a fundamental it's more of a principle it's one of like my guiding rules in life and I want to address it on this blog because a lot of people in the comments below whenever I do Q&amp;A is a lot of people ask me about what they should do when they're sort of at any kind of fork in the road any sort of crossroads in life and they need to make a decision what should they do and this is like big life decisions not like what should I have for lunch today in life you should only ever be doing one of two things and that is figuring out what you're most passionate about like finding your dreams in life and then to realizing those passions realizing those dreams and the first one is much harder than the second one if you know what you want to do no big deal you just commit your entire life to doing it and you'll either get really close or you'll die trying but figuring out what it is that excites you what it is that you're most passionate about in life is really really tricky so how how I approach it and this is how I've always approached it this is how I approached it when I was on welfare when I was 17 years old does I approach it when I was washing dishes when I was 20 this is how I've approached my entire life and that is to absolutely fixate on what it is that I want to be doing all day long every day like what am i doing right now is this exactly where I want to be and by always checking with myself always checking in like hitting that reset button I can always be really confident in my actions because I know that my ambition is true it's like that platitude without a goal you can't score I really believe in that because if you can't see like the goal posts how do you know which way to kick the ball now this is by no means a shortcut or a way to make life easier every time I've sort of made a big decision on what I wanted to do in life or I've discovered a passion it's been then like years of pain and years of struggle to realize or to even get myself on the course to realize that when I first discovered filmmaking and I was like this is all I want in life I was 17 years old I was on welfare it took me a decade before I figured out how to make a living at it when I decided that I didn't want to date anymore I didn't want to be single that I was unhappy I wanted a family it took me years to talk Candice into marrying me and then actually I was getting married and then having a baby so realizing it takes time and realizing that requires commitment but it's that first step that first decision point that enables you to sort of realize the ambition or at least begin the process to realize that ambition this is something I do every day even now I'm 34 years old I feel like I've come really far in life but I want to go much further and I'm constantly reevaluating my decisions and what I'm doing to make sure I'm on the path that I want to be on you know do I want to live in New York City forever I don't know I love this town but the idea of raising children here scares the crap out of me so that's something I'm constantly thinking about so anyways that's it it's a pretty simple idea it's something that I believe in to the point of it being like religion I am always fixated on what am i doing and what do I want to be doing and then that guides me that is like that that is the lighthouse that I follow through the darkness so what do I want to be doing right now right now I want to be doing two things number one sharing my ideas and sharing my perspectives and make these little creations that I plop on YouTube every day and number two is my new company and I know I haven't gotten into it yet but the ambition behind that company is to build something that can empower that can affect everyone on planet earth that can affect the whole world I realized that sounds lofty and ambitious but but your grasp should always be just outside your reach what's the point in having ambitions if they aren't seemingly unattainable okay that's it that's my big thought for today back to our regularly scheduled vlog tomorrow morning quick round on the beach with my friend Nev then the day starts I just kicked off the run NIMH how many VMAs have you been to this is probably my third and what should I expect today I would expect to be underwhelmed is it gonna be fun you can make it really fun need Sasha I'll see you guys at the VMAs okay take care got about an hour and a half before we have to go to the VMAs getting a quick haircut okay how would you say that this haircuts going so far it's going good I think so yeah I'm psyched thank you bye guys not a terrific amount of time after you back the hotel get changed to a couple of small things and then we got to go how are you okay there's a little bit longer to skateboard back from the hair place than I thought I'm a little sweaty I'm not dressed our car and driver arrived at 2:45 to pick us up it's currently not good because it's on TV you don't have to wear a suit just cuz you can dress down doesn't mean you should all right ready to go one small large problem left which is there's an inexplicable no camera allowed policy at the VMAs and this is what I've come up with first cell phones are loud so I'm gonna use this as a camera here are my waist I have two extra lenses these are both from my iPhone this is a wide-angle lens they attach like this and now I've got a pretty good camera additionally I'll be wearing this carpal tunnel wrist band which is actually a GoPro camera on a 360 degree swivel stick all right wish me luck thank you Tony we made it what do you think so far jack so far so good we should catch up by grace I Maxie guys I need to line up was point are you feeling we are literally on the red carpet in between Taylor Swift I'm surviving Jack give me an update we're about halfway through the neverending red carpet not even rest justa corner you think

hair standing up now Kanye is still on the stage in 2020 to run for president that was so awesome how much time to get set aside for that two minutes and how long did he pay it seemed like 20 running behind okay that's it VMAs are over yeah you guys want to get a dollar slice no all right here's have one slice please thank you this is day seven of the vlog it's been a week my main motivation in doing this is I wanted like I wanted an impetus a reason to be making movies every day it's been effective in that I haven't run around New York City with a camera in so long I'd forgotten how photogenic this city is it's like one gigantic movie said one week of blogging down second week begins now good morning Francine daddy's gonna go for a run I think I'm gonna run the West Side Highway this morning it's pretty over there okay this is my halfway point for today now I turn on run home okay that's a wrap ten point three miles at a 7/16 cage Oh take that there's no hot water in my apartment building look that sucks oh so holes trying something a little different today on the vlog I don't know what it's called but it's like a Q&amp;A segment ashes by you answered by me that's my friend Alec but first here's a quick intro sequence Jack and I shot last summer okay Q&amp;A got me good micro okay I never actually plugged in the good microphone so the sound you're hearing is from the on-board microphone which is terrible and super echo II I'm sorry it was a mistake but I'm not gonna rerecord all these questions and answers that's ridiculous okay Sebastian wants to know what is your favorite kind of sandwich I like peanut butter and jelly what do you regard when putting up a video in order to get more views likes shares etc I don't consider any of that I try to make the best movies I can and if people watch them great if not as long as I feel good about them that's all that matters you should never try to like pander to an audience it will never get you anywhere what do you wish you could have done differently that's a tough question done differently I don't know I try not to look back because I'm really happy where I am had I done things differently I might not be where I am today so I maybe I wouldn't have done anything differently well how do you always have a brilliant idea for your videos thanks for the compliment I don't always have a brilliant idea if you were to reduce any one of my movies down to a single idea we would find a perfectly mediocre idea it's the execution that matters never the idea Giovani asks what's the best thing about having a baby having kids is like it's a having kids it's a sense of purpose it's like before you have kids it's just you acting for you but when you have kids it's you acting for someone else and that just makes life feel so much more substantial Lily wants to know what editing system do you use I currently use Final Cut Pro 10 that is not an endorsement Andrew asks what's the business you just launched I will get that Andrew I promise but not now Natali asks what advice would you give us someone who wants to travel the world but doesn't know how get a job what was your biggest dream when you were a kid I wanted to live a life where no one could tell me what to do how do you fight distractions I don't I embrace distractions can I do a kickflip hi can I do a kickflip I don't know but I can try you

you want to remember how to pronounce my last name just picture that butterfly tattooed on your ankle or that sweet tribal design on your lower back and think to yourself that's a nice tat nice tat there's any question as to why I wear the same clothes every day this is my closet I'm supposed to have cleaned and organized this closet months ago but but this just seems like a daunting task in very uninteresting use of time so basically I just wash my clothes at the end of every day and then wear the same outfit the next day and that enables me to avoid this honestly I'm thinking about just boarding up the door and buying all new clothes bye puppy have a good day puppy early breakfast meeting this morning actually especially early this morning I'm taking the bike this makes me so sad look cobblestone streets that's being paved over with asphalt it's like a little piece of the city is dying this place has become our go-to breakfast meeting spot a.m. morning I definitely could have walked this morning meeting it's like such a wonderful day for a bike ride how could you possibly say no and I am getting the office after that breakfast meeting so pretty good about it yo yo here's my brother you're in the vlog now a meeting now with some folks from the verge which is like a technology website maybe the best technology website Lord how many people do they bring pie I'll get that what's up guys okay see this is a team verge video all right you should run a couple more people with you lovely day in New York City that's the posse we're going to get some sandwiches your sandwiches are delicious but it gets a little crowded I got a briefcase man it was 144 dollars but we can return it after the shoot how do you get a briefcase and a suit Jack and I are going to shoot something fun this afternoon this is prop and costume this is a spontaneous shoot it involves me wearing a suit it involves a briefcase and it involves a lot of New York City we don't we don't have a lot of time to do this and I was really looked I was really happy to shoot this on VHS like on a super old video camera and those things never worked so we have a lot of variables here Jack's coming over now here comes Jack jacqui ready yeah you sure that thing works okay it looks good on you man that VHS camera what we were doing out there shooting an intro sequence for a new segment that I want to do let me play it so I really want to start getting into my new company on this vlog and I want to start making it like a regular feature of this vlog where I talk about my company and what I'm doing first I want to talk about why I can't talk about it and that is we're making something that's new in certain aspects of we're ranking are completely new I think that and our patent lawyers think that if you talk about something in the public domain you can't then submit a patent application for it so we can't talk about this until that patent application happens and then I can start getting into specifics I hope that makes sense it's exciting but there is stuff that I can talk about beyond that like this physical space this is my main studio this is where I've been for the last 13 years this is where I make movies the new company is in the same building just down the hall this is the new space this is where the new company lives and everything that went into me starting this company that's been over a year of my life has gone into figuring out how to make this happen how to get this started we're still in our infancy here it's still all very new so there's a lot to attach to this there's a lot that I'm very excited to share on this vlog take this as like an introduction to this new segment which is all about this new business I know that's still just like a little bit of detail and like missing a lot of detail but it's coming headed home it's still light out so that's a plus this is the view out of our bedroom window where we have no blinds and that's our bad there's and watch us to our dirty business everything that sorry go edit my blog looking for a girlfriend I'm really looking for a girlfriend this is not a joke just tired of the single scene and hoping to meet the right person this guy finds the right person my friend Andy Spade is basically a genius once said to me that work and family would make a great name for a business because that's

pizzas not open yet how am I supposed to do now ah that's so disappointing okay it's Friday it's not pizza for breakfast eh ah man what a way to start my day [Music] nobody else is here yet the team at the new company is up to nine people I think and I'm usually never the first person in the office somebody's been here because the lights are on and everything's all alive dude I think this is it you know what it is you got my Apple watch yes my brother you got two Apple watches for me too you're a good man the best the best the best delivering to the best yeah yeah look you gotta be kidding right take care bye Marlon okay so in my video where I spray-painted an Apple watch gold that was actually my friends I actually don't have an Apple watch yet but then I couldn't decide which one to yet so I got the girl sighs and the boys sighs and they both showed up today the girl sighs it's kind of the same size is my old watch that does this look wimpy yeah my wrist is huge but does this look wimpy what do you think Evan wimpy so it's wimpy this is the most gentle unpacking I've ever done except a male one of these back bigger one so the bigger one huh all right the big one it is now that I have my Apple watch I have to customize my Apple watch first up I like to write my name on everything I own show [Music] still works that worked well I think the Apple watch is probably the most ostentatious watch you can possibly buy so I think it should have an equally ostentatious band and this thing just isn't cutting it so I had this guy called the strap Smith in Montana hand-stitched me a Louis Vuitton Apple watch band this is made out of an actual old Louis Vuitton handbag I feel like it's a little bit more appropriate [Music] I got it and I made it look really easy in this video but the truth is I completely screwed up taking apart this watch which Apple specifically does not want you to do they don't want you putting your own loot on bands on their watches and it's been like four hours since I began this process that a machine my own tools like this screwdriver I actually had the machine by using the Dremel to sharpen it I mean I need to hammer it into the screws in the band and then I to use a dremel to cut away some of the Apple stainless steel anyways three hours later I got my watch I have eight minutes to skate to Union Square which is about 20 minutes away I thought I had my bicycle I don't know where I left my bike so I'm on skateboard [Music] a friend of mine named Kim is an instructor at soul cycle which is like a really fancy spin class and she's in town and she invited me to go to class today for free so that's where I'm headed to now Kim is a super interesting girl I'll link her channel here here here or something she um she was on that TV show called The Amazing Race and she might be the fittest human being I've ever met all right this is it you know the thing is with these selfies you gotta be fast you gotta be fast move that's a good one right nice to meet you take care [Applause] good to see you thanks for class your mom you look awesome by the way you always look the same fun I'm feeling good I'm feeling great hope to see you again before Monday headed home now got my new Apple watch and special guest the poodle not that girl [Music] how awesome was that time-lapse that was like this crazy rainstorm that came through last night I said yesterday that probably wouldn't be vlogging today the thing about funerals is that you actually have kind of a lot of downtime I can't actually be like normally vlogging where I like show everything that I'm up to but there's something therapeutic about talking to a camera for me so this is actually kind of nice and I thought I could make a vlog about the things that I do today that are not like sad family-oriented but these other distractions that I'm finding for myself right now I'm at this right now I'm sitting in the tree but I'm at this weirdo kind of country-club thing that Candace's parents belong to and I was in this area earlier where they have like free coffee and pretzels and iced tea and it was quiet and that good internet and I was gonna vlog from there but it's also connected to the men's locker room so they were just like naked there were naked old men like walking through the area a lot and I thought they might freak out if I brought my camera here's my schedule for today exercise here at this Country Club place at some point in time I'm going to try again in buy a new laptop then we are staying at this like fun fancy hotel so I may be able to feature some fun fancy hotel stuff in there and that's the very best I have to offer for today's vlog tomorrow is gonna suck even more cuz tomorrow's the actual funeral so I won't probably be able to blog at all but just hanging in there if today's vlog sucks just stop watching I'll be back to my normal vlogging by like the end of this week and honestly as weird as this sounds I'm very glad to have blogging to distract me from the realities of life and family and stuff okay there's this outdoor jungle gym that they have here that looks a lot more interesting than the actual gym I think I'm just gonna change into my gym clothes out here hope no one sees me yeah [Music] all right time to get pumped up on this channel Jim [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay playing in the trees is discouraged by security here at the Houstonian no problem [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I don't really know what I'm supposed to be doing here I'm gonna put the camera away go to the regular gym now okay what a nice nap who did what are you doing what are you doing why don't you see they're eight that

is so much better when you have someone to share it with when you have family to share with it's great when you have friends to share it with it's amazing and if you're really really lucky if you meet a stranger in your lifetime and decide that you want to share your life with that stranger that's amazing that is the that is one of the greatest parts of life a shared life is a great life but by but by Francine I'll see you later just check this out real question look at that closet it's almost organized in there I just say that because you'll notice I'm wearing different clothes today that I have been to last month it's because I found them in my closet when Candace cleaned it the reason why we come here for all of our breakfast means is it's like the best breakfast place downtown all their eggs were organic and delicious and their fruits amazing and they have this cow out front I have the eggs this morning Pepi eggs this morning they were delicious I got sigh okay yesterday's vlog I was talking about true originals I have a very I have one of my favorite filmmakers one of the greatest filmmakers in my office right now mr. Joshua safty Josh and I made a couple movies together including including this movie daddy longlegs which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival Sundance which one all the stuff that everybody wants to hear did the Sundance Film Festival we won we won this we won this award for a movie for the same movie dining long legs anyways all of this success was under this guy's brilliance and his brother's brilliance and Josh is here today showing me the trailer for his new film which just give me like five accolades from this movie it showed at Venice Film Festival Toronto Film Festival won the Tokyo grand prize and Weinstein Company radius is releasing it so anyways josh is kind of a big deal and we're watching his new trailer here which like and this is a watermark cuz no one's allowed to see it yet we're watching it could play I'm so sorry things had to come to this it's so good so good I saw the movie at the New York Film Festival right yeah at the New York Film Festival it's amazing anyways I'll put a link to the trailer below if I don't I'm sorry it's because Josh wouldn't let me euros I'm very happy to announce at today's the day that I make a vlog all about Candice here's the story about Candice one that I've never told Candice was a waitress when she moved to New York City she's a bartender she was a waitress and she had this dream of starting a jewelry company so her and her girlfriend started this company and they ran it out of her apartment like literally off the kitchen table and it grew and it grew and it grew and then her and her partner sort of went separate ways they had a falling-out Candice didn't know what to do she wanted to shut down the company and this is right when her and I were getting serious and I remember thinking to myself I could never be with a quitter I could never be with somebody who just gives up when the going gets tough cuz that's what she wanted to do after her and her partner split up but she didn't she stuck with it she made the company more successful than it ever was with her partner and like when that happened when she did that that's when I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this girl that was when I bought the ring that was when I proposed to her is because I knew she wasn't a quitter she was a fighter she was an ambitious creative smart fighter and that's who Candice is she's also cute and shy and gets nervous about being on these blogs riding my bike up to Candace's office now she's like ten blocks away from my office / elevators locked so I had to take the stairs no wait I thought you said today was Candace vlog day I made promises to the viewers this is Candace's super fancy showroom and this is all press for her company like look that's all for jewelry from a magazine and that's like some really pretty famous person with her jewelry on and we're pretty stuff and this is like that pretty famous person and this famous person and that famous stuff why don't you like to be on camera cuz I feel silly why do you feel silly I don't know some people just feel natural in front of it and I don't I'm like gonna have a panic attack right now why don't we crowdsource questions okay that's a good idea right yeah if Frankie was a boy what would her name be Frankie that's a good answer do you think she looks like Pam from the office or is it just me she kinda doesn't like Pam from the office wow she's really heard um how do you design such awesome jewelry I'd like though the answer to that um just do it have an idea and do it like that what about Casey's work do you find most interesting your inhibition my inhibition what does that mean it means um you do whatever you think is right instead of what other people think is right thank you don't look normal relax okay Luke wants to know what pisses you off most about having Casey as a spouse the battery's gonna die before she finishes this go um that's hard because it's also the thing that I admire the most about you what's that how hard you work okay thank you that's nice ooh I like this question do you get jealous of all the female admirers Casey has no really we're not much jealousy in our relationship who are you most proud to have worn your jewelry Giselle Giselle that was a good one Karlie Kloss Karlie Kloss she's the most recent good one how did you need Carly Foss random how do you tolerate Casey's vlog so I can get my wife to tolerate mine I always support your man okay I'm answering this question which one of your which one of Casey's tattoos is your favorite on our second date on our second date Candice and I thought it'd be a really good idea to tattoo each other's names on are like foot huh it was her idea she paid for it okay that we broke up and she got hers covered up and I didn't that's Candace is that your favorite tattoo that I have you have to say yes yes um why don't you like being Casey's vlogs I don't like being judged in any way I think that's fair did you see my vlog about being judge yes and then some bitch says something about me um what's your ideal place to travel with me Amsterdam and Cape Town am strands where I proposed to her Cape Town's where we got married uh are you going to start your own rival YouTube channel Casey they can just give you advice about the vlog or the new company yes I don't they have to do it without our support Oh where's married life with Casey like non-stop what does that mean chaos that's my new word for you what just non-stop chaos Gretchen wants to know have you ever doubted Casey not once since the minute I met you so nice all right that's it end of the Q&amp;A stop I have to sit here stop sending questions thanks for being the vlog is there anything else you want to say no sorry I'm so boring you're not

morning certainly 903 keeping late for meetings if you're out here that means I'm not late late what's going on here how's life you make it look nice yesterday I posted a 360 video of my office and the tin 4k super high definition so you can inspect this whole office but I'm going to point out three three things that maybe you didn't notice versus this picture that's my brother van that's me and that's my sister Jordan so I hope you didn't notice that okay number two this letter from Porsche from 2005 addressed to me from whoever this is dr. Porsche dear mr. Knight said thank you very much for your kind inquiries we blah blah blah blah blah blah however we are not able to support your project alright this was I did a show in Paris and there wasn't enough money to do all the things that I wanted to do in the show so I asked Porsche to sponsor it in to give us I think a hundred thousand dollars in a bunch of Porsches that was the letter they sent me in response saying no we will not sponsor your show okay the third thing maybe you didn't notice in here would be this license plate here this is a license plate for my old motorcycle looks legit right okay I almost went to jail because I was pulled over by a cop who touched this license plate and realized it's not a real license plate but a piece of paper taped to a piece of plastic I lost my license plate so I just made one in Photoshop and what I didn't realize is that like this is a major federal offense counterfeit license plates it's my real license plate number anyways don't do that okay now we can begin for today's Q&amp;A I asked you guys what the theme of the Q&amp;A should be honestly I didn't really like any of the ideas that came at me so I just suggested that today's theme should be New York City all questions pertaining to New York City okay let's begin Casey where do you go grocery shopping in New York City uh we don't go grocery shopping sometimes you go to Whole Foods but that's just for fun so we order it using Amazon Prime or another service and it just kind of shows up at the door Laurens asks how do you cope with noise pollution Lawrence of all of the difficulties that are living in New York City noise pollution is the one that Trump's them all for me it makes me crazy like the smell of rotten garbage juice that just floods your face first thing in the morning when you step outside is nothing for me compared to noise pollution so how I cope with it is not very well and it will be like the main reason why I leave this city hear that noise I'm inside of a building Conrad asks where do you do the most epic time lapses you know the beauty of this city is that you go anywhere I just point the camera and it's incredible this entire city is like a movie set my favorite places are on the fringe of the city where you can actually see the skyline but honestly it's like this city is so cinematic it's one of the reasons why I love it Glen asks where's your favorite place to relax in New York City I don't relax in New York City we leave the city to relax Isaac Rosen asks why New York City great question I was like really an outcast when I lived outside of the city I never felt like my ideas were welcomed or warranted and I was kind of always told I was wrong and New York City is like this Isle of refuge for people who are sort of outliers people who don't we follow the norm that's why I moved to New York City I never felt like I belonged or fit in in this world until I moved here to New York City why don't you like the subway of New York City I love that the subway exists it's an incredible incredible thing I just don't like being in the subway I don't like being close to people ever that's probably the biggest thing I don't like being underground I feel trapped there and also it's like you have no control in the subway I can't control whether it goes or stops or get stuck or is air conditioned or is hot and that freaks me out how tall is the Statue of Liberty 305 feet Colleen asks what's the one thing about New York City that most people don't know I would say that people here are incredibly friendly it's when you're all like 8 million 9 million people packed into a tiny little city you have to be good neighbors and you have to share space and the city has this app don't get me wrong but for the most part the people here are incredibly friendly and helpful and nice and you all sort of share a common bond which is that you share this small space do you recommend living in New York City yes I think everyone should live here at least once in their life if New York City were to have it if New York City were to have a taste what would it be it would either be garbage or dollar pizza what made you move to New York City I had nowhere else to go Murray asks what's your favorite skyscraper and what's the worst one my favorite with that question is the Empire State Building it just looks like New York City and my least favorite is the New World Trade Center it's this awkward weird looking compromise thing that looks like it belongs in Toronto no offense Toronto all right last question do you hear that noise listen okay that's not noise pollution I was talking about last question how big our business potentials in New York City just the potential of New York City like if there's something you want to do and you want to make it this is the place for that this is uniquely the place for that you can do things here get away with things here build things here start things here that you can only do here and that is the magic of New York City that's what like Frank Sinatra says if you can make it there you can make it anywhere if I can he's talking about here whatever cool thing jay-z says in that song about New York City I'm the new Sinatra he's talking about here and that is the magic of this place the horror of this place is this terrible noise pollution do you hear this the noise that these things make is my least favorite sound that that noise is my least favorite part of New York City if you definitely go follow me and be my username is Chloe Donald because I'm a

follow me on being because I'm a traveling salesman a new place a new adventure every week B I ll see a and O hope that made sense Billy Cano on B thanks see you later well that's awesome it's pie-der-man that's scary up there I don't love getting presents I never know how to react I always feel like I'm not showing enough appreciation and then I feel ingratiate it to whoever gave me the gift but I love giving presents I love giving presents on holidays I love giving presents for no reason at all I love giving people presents tomorrow is Mother's Day I'm running the Starbucks to get Candice and coffee because tomorrow's Mother's Day but I haven't I haven't actually gotten or anything for Mother's Day yet and I'm watching the baby all day today so I'm in a bit of a conundrum here I'm also on the motorized unicycle yo what's up guys I got the copy but the mothersday problem remains okay little update she's in the shower now the trouble is I don't know how to get away from her today long enough to buy her some Mother's Day presents never wait to the last minute I have a couple of good Mother's Day present ideas but they're going to be really tricky to pull off without her noticing ready to buy GG bye bye alright we're now out shopping but we're like joined-at-the-hip I just stepped away for one second if I don't succeed in doing something great for Mother's Day this vlog episode will also be a total bust I think she's in here with all the other moms are you photobombing me are you shopping for Spanx it's so embarrassing how did you know where I was I'm pushing the baby around the lingerie section of Bloomingdale's well can't disguise on Spanx these are playing great music okay quick update we are grabbing lunch now and then she's gonna go meet her friends so I can work bye okay bye bye and so it begins okay so I made it to my office I just want to quickly explain some of my thinking behind the Mother's Day gift giving before I hit the road okay so here's what I'm thinking this is a three-part attack plan three parts you've got your one you've got your two you've got your three now here we've got smile and swooned that's the gift that's gonna make her go oh very important number two that's surprise and delight surprise sir prop prot serpro I don't want to spell surprise if it's spelt wrong I apologize surprise Z surprise with an S though I don't have a small surprise okay part three that's shock and awe and AH now we're all three of these factors overlap that is the sweet spot for all the married men out there and all the young men who someday aspired to be married the highest level of appreciation you can ever get from your wife is good job so this is what I strive for right here let's discuss actionable shock-and-awe happens to be my specialty it's just it's gratuitous sensationalism it's just a way so when she wakes up it screams at our happy and Mother's Day so I do that with flowers and balloon surprise and delight now this one requires quite a bit of forethought now I've got something amazing going on here I got Candice a bicycle with a baby seat on the back pretty good then the smiling spoon this is the trickiest of them all I'm going to get like a beautiful picture frame and right Candice's first Mother's Day something like that and then the date in there and then I'm going to take Francine's hands put them in paint and put it in there so this is my strategy here it gets a little bit complicated because it gets a little complicated because this I have to actually do before tomorrow I don't know how to pull that off this stuff I can get now hide it at the office I guess come get it in the middle of the night the bike I'm going to go pick up this afternoon and then I'm not sure I'm not sure where to hide it but I'll figure it out this is really the variable this is the unknown it's definitely the smile and swoon that I'm most concerned about okay I gotta get the hell out of the studio now so I can go get started on this operation I think I went maybe a little overboard with the balloons works I guess literally one minute after I dropped off those balloons I get a text from Candace saying I need your help because the baby's crying so now I got a race to go find her and act like everything's cool did you have a nice day with mommy Francine did you have a nice day mommy got it smells like weed again our neighbors love weed and mighty taiko hey are you sure you're okay till 7:00 I'll be right back sorry bye now she's putting the baby to bed now so I have no idea what I'm going to do like the baby handprint in the frame thing looking good okay quick inventory here smile and swim picture frame in the basket of the bunch got it shock and awe that's flowers balloons got the balloons flowers are there check final surprise and delight which is the bicycle right there getting close - good job Casey its 451 in the morning I try to hit the balloons the balloons are the real risk if one of these pops in the living room there's no way she's not waking up set dogs in the screen so I think I bring in the bike first the flower second the balloons last I bring in the balloons and small batches to make sure they don't touch the walls of the seal okay I'm in my apartment building I can get the bicycle first no one stole it that's the flowers and all that remains now or the balloons get 6 a.m. now balloons are in place bike is in place drawing is in place flowers are in place everyone's still asleep and the dog hasn't barked I think the babies are francy I need you to help me with one last present for mommy okay will you help me you did a nice job oh my god Stacy you always go so crazy do we need a leash you are from the beach welcome to the beach right and early on a Sunday were going for a family walk to the beach Owen had to work at 6:00 a.m. this morning so this is only part of the family daddy come here Gigi don't you run in the street don't you run in the street you lucky that crazy poodle is 13 years old look at her gg-go digi I think she's gonna pass out is it still there look it is it says CN and C P that means KC nice tat and Candice pool I'm going to run back to the beach okay headed back to the beach there's something I want to do alright I'm letting one of the Townies try it see if this is a good idea not sir sorta it's like a balance board give it some gas you're gonna go to grandpa's again get some breakfast again there's you're not gonna like getting in the car right now back on my dad's for some more free lunch in addition to the delicious food the girls here watch the baby killing cycles oh so daddy is Hana hi pretend it's the old days and just give you 20 to buy something yeah take 20 bucks take it but as things change okay kit whoa nice car bye dad see a little bit thank nearly time to go almost unpacking on what else besides this bag in the car for five minutes hit some pretty severe traffic it should be a super fun ride home we needed food we couldn't find any ice we find her Chipotle on the side of the street we're gonna sit out here lit by the cars headlights what'd you get me mixed up angry at so it was a fine meal this is for the dog Gigi what you got yeah it's my other baby we're driving in Francine had a little bit of a freak out so we're taking a driving bathroom gasps break in some really shady town maybe in Connecticut or New York is what it looks like we're probably still like an hour away from home this is like the endless drive back to New York City oh wow finally back in the city is 1:00 in the morning their work lift the seat up yay 5050 movies it took me five years through the first hundred movies in 50 days to make the next 50 movies pretty excited about that thank you for tuning it so for today's vlog I wanted to start by giving a little walkthrough of you know what I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do this outside so what I wanted to do outside today is give like a little walkthrough of what cameras i use for vlogging first let me just start by saying i highly encourage any young filmmakers out there that are thinking about making movies for a living to start daily vlogging and that doesn't mean like doing a daily video about what you did that day or journal it just means constantly making new content make something new every day no matter what and eventually you will get good okay so let's talk gear for the longest time this was my go-to camera this is the canon s120 it's a rock-solid camera it costs three hundred and fifty dollars let me just show you a little bit of what the quality looks like this is what the s120 looks like this is what I look like when I'm shooting with the s120 and you can see the sounds not quite as good as my big camera over here which has an actual microphone on it this is the canon g7x and compared to the s120 you can see it's almost twice as fat it's a little bit taller a little bit wider just doesn't fit in your pants unless you were a big cargo pants I swear canon invented this just for vloggers because while vlogging you flip this up and you can see yourself here in the monitor so you can see how you look make sure the right things and focus all that it's a good all-round camera it's a dynamic camera the g7x cost six hundred and fifty bucks which is almost double the price of the s 120 I don't know if it's twice as good just a caveat this thing is fragile the cheaper one is robust you can beat the hell out of this thing these I go through like tic tacs the focus fades on them there's just a lot of moving parts already like the lens cap on this thing open it gets jammed up so it's fragile and fragility is something you don't want in your daily shooter so as good as this thing is and it is pretty good it's still not quite good enough it still feels like when I look at this footage that I'm looking at someone who has a point shoot that they're holding out in front of them and I wanted something richer honestly what I want is I want a camera that looks like someone is walking in front of me walking backward holding a professional camera that's on a Steadicam so this is what I've built this is what I'm looking for what you're seeing right now and what this is is a Canon 70d and then I have this rode microphone on here which is hyper directional you hear me clearly now but as I turn it like this the sound sort of goes away and what that means is all the sounds on that side of the microphone don't get picked up and it really just zeroes in on what I'm saying and this camera is a little heavy so holding the camera like this didn't make sense so I use this gorilla pod as sort of a selfie stick it's actually pretty comfortable I can keep my arm loan up so in the image it doesn't I don't look like this I'm just holding out like this and if I really want to get fancy I can zoom in a little and the image looks like that with these vlogs one of my goals is to have you the viewers forget that I'm filming myself and just have it feel like you're watching a movie is it cool if you share your office with me so I can shoot around here you see anything for you my brother all right anything for you man ah I'll see you up there yeah where is he a professional biker who bites for the red bull what to call want to break free right now I'm like free I did get to see him and the plan was for me Slav and I to go for a bike ride I've got my whip here he ain't got no bike it's a lost one the last one make it yours so you've never ridden a bike in New York City before you look good on it thank you easy there killer whoa thank you so much have a good day what about the story of when you broke your back I was trying to recreate the rebel logo doing a front foot because my body is in the same position as the pool on the logo so there was a sunset and we built a jump we did front flips because the Sun is moving like we only had 15 minutes so I had to do 16 front flips and I I was just start and I lost my my concentration and crashed on my back and my disc broke so do you think you'll ever front flip again from flick ah not really maybe into the pumping I could teach you that you know back when least-loved taught me how to backflip and this when we first met but taught me how to backflip a mountain bike on my birthday like three years ago yeah what's the first thing I need to know try to pull hard and rotation and land on your wheels piece of cake man yeah you got you fun times my presence II thank you thank you whoa which one are you the right that's pretty amazing thank you yeah it was the best moment of my life and the worst so and right now me slobs trying to get a job in marketing working for Red Bull so check out the work he's done for them and send him some love on Instagram is it cool that I said there meets love see later man I love that guy running out of the office now trying to get home before Britain seen falls asleep she's falling asleep the last three nights in a row before I got home which really makes me feel like a bad dad I hope I made it dogs to watch if she's still awake this is deeply disturbing it says New York City Children's Services Division Youth and Family Justice and it's like this terrifying looking van with padlocks and metal windows do they put children in that band this this is vlog number 34 yesterday was vlog number 33 but I labeled yesterday's vlog 32 so out of 32 vlogs I've missed numbered four of them so my failure rate when it comes to numbering these vlogs is over 10% editing these things is like effortless for me it's pure intuition but numbering them putting text the titles it requires every ounce of energy I could give them and I still pick it up ten percent of the time not only cars free you are the only car on the street and on top of that I can clearly see your ticket from up here a budget your budget two tickets a month all right got a solid hour this morning can you get in some miles ten point seven miles at a 718 pace special feature with this morning's walk to work Candace is leaving living look at that happy Monday morning face I'm gonna go buy okay special special segment for today's vlog I don't know what this segment is yeah I guess this is let's talk about business this is a really abstract let's talk about business segments plus I really want to place intro again I need like a prop for this but I think it's up there I want to tell the story of my HBO show why this is part of the narrative behind my new business this project this series this show represented what was my greatest achievement and what is my greatest failure of my career thus far okay here's the super abbreviated story of how the show came to be in 2000 plus five my brother van and I met this incredible man named Tom Scott he's the Tom from Tom and Tom that invented Nantucket nectars Nantucket nectars began with two guys named Tom yes that is the top anyways that guy Tom had sold Nantucket nectars and he started this public-access TV network and he asked my brother me to make a movie about his public-access TV networks the only creative direction he gave us was make sure it's respectable so we made this movie it was called the respectability tour we made this movie for Tom he loved it and then he came to my brother and me and he just said he said let's do something big together and we said let's do a TV show at the end of that year we took that out to Los Angeles and we shopped it most places didn't like it HBO loved it so we sold it to them okay a quick recap I was a kid poor in my trailer park making movies with a big drink a few years later I sold my own TV show to HBO the biggest baddest name in television this is where my biggest failure begins because that was by far my biggest success at the time but HBO didn't air the show for two years and in those two years I did nothing I did nothing because I hadn't made it I'd sold my show something I made to the biggest baddest TV channel in the business I had made it then they aired the show I honestly expected my whole life to be different but the truth is nothing changed and then they ran reruns and all the Apple is kind of over in like six months and this is where the most valuable lesson comes in you never actually make it there's never any making it you've never arrived like that platitude the journey is the destination it's cliché for a reason because it's really true I'm just going to do a little drawing that shows what I mean what I say you never actually make it start and then here is life and for me I start busting my busting my chops and I find this success and then I get to this place right here and this is when HBO bought my show and I thought this was making it I thought I had made it right there so I backed off I stopped fighting and I just kind of like chilled out and did nothing for a couple of years and then the show aired and it was like over and I looked around and here's where I was this is where I learned that like life does have ups and downs but you have to keep fighting and busting your ass to go like this you've got to maintain that you can never get comfortable because when you get comfortable this is what happens Comfort this this is comfort comfort is declined this is fight you fight your way up so when I said that this story has an abstract connection with my new company I started this new company and there was no reason for me to start a new company I mean that I was doing really great for the first time in my life I had like some job security there's no reason for me to start this company but the desire was there and the desire had to be respected I couldn't get comfortable I had to keep fighting so that's why I'm rolling the dice and that's why I'm going for it right now is because is because this this will never happen again in my life this is me and this is the horrible hard-fought lesson that was my HBO series so the take away you've never made it with each success must come a newer and more ambitious goal you haven't crossed the finish line until you die broke leaving the world a better place than when you found it back to the new company this is the bigger more ambitious goal leading the office now seven o'clock have a dinner meeting tonight which I'd like to get ready I'm in the bathroom of this place where we're having our business meeting I'm very sleepy I'm having trouble keeping my eyes open now pull it together the selfie stick what in God's name I really like my cellphone I like my camera I like my other cell phone I like gadgets and I make no apologies for liking gadgets I don't any possessions I really care about in life but these little tools enable us to do so much so with that I think it's totally ok to be excited about a watch I think it's ok Saturday morning today is not a workday just running into the studio super fast to grab my bicycle I have something planned for this morning it's pretty stupid but I'm psyched to do so my employment begins in five minutes and my appointment is to go try on an Apple watch okay this is the Apple store and so my appointment was for 10:30 10:30 to hoping this so let me try it on can I take pictures of this whole thing oh yes hey I'm Casey now you're in my vlog just watching it with my girlfriend last night I love doing that are you gonna show me a watch yes he's doing oh there they are the watches give you a little demo well this feels good the notification it feels really good I'm not being paid to say this yeah this one's my favorite I bet you that's my favorite thank you this is awesome I hate to be such a fanboy but that whole experience was really lovely the guy who helped me was great the watch seems cool will I get one yes but I think I'm just me at the cheapest one you can buy the cheapest one you can buy in the boy size not the girl size this bookstore is where every mom in Tribeca in this neighborhood brings their babies every day I don't think any of them even buy anything this is just like the baby hangout for for lower Manhattan yes they have a stroller parking area it is astonishing this whole baby thing they do

Jack boy what what you doing on the road I don't know I'm trying to stay physically fit so I made it to Brooklyn there is just entirely too many things to take pictures up here that Brooklyn Bridge there that's my camera there there were some hood rats around here earlier they like tried to grab my stuff they didn't get it those are the hood rats they're they like scrap my GoPro please listen you can't be hit the kid from the Lakers Scylla Brooklyn are now out on a pier fantastic view of lower Manhattan and Novogratz to contentment okay firing up all cylinders here here's a tiny preview of what's to come the long lens Lady Liberty there this is the wide shot of the whole city with the Sun silhouetted behind it then my iPhone is getting the kind of generic but nice and level and clean lower Manhattan shot and the girl froze the wild card who knows what that Ben's getting sunset update and Sun is almost gone I didn't bring any warmer clothes than this I'm just wearing a t-shirt under here I'm freezing starting to geta I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous about how cold it is up I totally forgot this camera here I biked away like a mile I cannot believe this camera is still here cam headed home check out my bike wheels finally home it's free late today has been an incredibly productive day ah I'm in st. Barts which is like a small island somewhere in the Caribbean today is March 25th 2015 it's also my 34th birthday and I have a big announcement to make let me explain see I'm 34 years old and I've never had so much going on in my life I got married like a year ago had a kid three months ago my other kid Owen he's driving now I've been traveling a lot with and without the family I'm also helping my supermodel friend Carly cloth start a YouTube channel I'm not your supermodel friend where does your friend I'm still spending time at MIT working at the Media Lab I started a new business and sometimes but not enough making movies I want to make more movies but there's so much going on in my life it makes it tough so I've decided starting today my 34th birthday I'm going to make a movie every day for a while anyways but until I get forward yes I'm starting a proper and daily vlog I'm psyched so this is the first vlog entry but let me start this morning back in New York City it's 5:00 a.m. our flights in three hours we have to leave in like 10 minutes okay honey this is so much stuff [Music] ladies thanks for the ride I'll see you Monday so for my birthday me and the fam we're taking right [Music] Candace's sisters here do you know this Carly just happens to be here and her sister's husband doesn't know that we're here so it's gonna be a big surprise this is our rental tea we're staying with friends we don't know where our friends live but we think it's this one this is how you call a st. Bart's traffic jam what do we do to be somebody else now let's go find out what your freaking honey it's the cutest little friendliest little lizard you have nowhere to go lizard way I feel about butterflies he's never know where they are and they're gonna touch you or not honey butterflies ready whoa incoming oh they're coming headed to town we're gonna pick up Candace's sister so they can come back for my birthday dinner yo what's up guys yo starting a blog do you guys want to be in it yes great you're in it no but this is before you're offering what's been your favorite part what's your favorite part of st. Bart's Francine alright just follows up are you driving a standard [Music] blow this out [Music] are you gonna accept your packages it oh yeah well you keep you keeping me walking - it'll keep me busy yeah you scratch my back I scratch you exactly that's what somebody asks in the comments what this um black bag is that's always on my hip this thing is just a little like camera pouch it's where I keep my point-and-shoot and this is just too bulky to like fit in a pocket you know it's like that's a lot to deal with Owen says I look like a grandpa for keeping it on my waist yesterday this company called moment send me this cute little thing what do you see how tiny that is and in here is it tiny iPhone camera lens it clips on like that and it's like this is the wide-angle lens so it looks like this instead of like this but I honestly don't know if I can actually deal with carrying anything else on my waist I'm starting to feel like Batman with all these like attachments on my belt so I just yesterday finished a new video and anyways it's like a short video about how I made these Google glasses so I thought I would take like a few minutes of today's vlog and give like a little bit of behind-the-scenes perspective on Google glass so I was a pretty early adopter when it came to Google glass who's that this is one of my early pairs this is with Google's frame on it like I thought the whole face computer thing was super dumb I still think it's super dumb but using a Google glass as a video camera is incredible literally anything you saw with your eyes you go like this and then you can film whatever you're seeing and like a year of my life where I literally like wore these things all the time and I was able to film everything in fact I made a video I'll link it I'll link it here all shot on Google glass of me running around the world this is some footage from Amsterdam when I was there last year with my friend jack harries let's see where's Jack's handsome face but it's all captured from my perspective this clip is just called highest people ever it's a real one yeah and you got gold right I do it both faces yeah listen you guys those are just like the two most stoned human beings on planet earth and like Jack and I were just walking around Amsterdam we ran into them and I happen to film them so that's why I made these because I just like I love the camera but I couldn't stand the ridicule so I thought if I made them and made them look more like like my regular glasses that I could get away with it this is the final build they're like super sturdy and rigid and they're pretty tough they fit me really well they're super comfortable these lenses are like transitions when you go into sunlight they turn into sunglasses and I don't wear them so much anymore because I did it for a year and a half I don't know why else what else to do with them watch the video if you haven't seen it yet and I would say make your own Google glasses like mine but that's a terrible idea do not do that every day it's lunch in the same place got that I minded but every day it's lunch at the same place this invitation here you specifically are cordially invited to the ceremonious oh wow that's a lot of words anyways tonight 7:00 p.m. for Cortlandt alley Cortlandt alley is directly behind my office here what's going on out there there's a lot of

around the subway is like slow a little bit complicated taxis are hard to find in they're expensive there's over now but the loophole to the city is a bicycle on a bike you can get anywhere you need to be for the most part in all five boroughs in about 20 minutes Staten Island notwithstanding the price for riding a bike is high though I've never owned a bike for more than maybe a year before it's been stolen you get hurt all the time they break a lot but if you make the choice if you ride the bike your relationship with this city is so much better we packed it in here yes Candace I dropped the worst thing I could have possibly dropped yes what do I do oh this isn't it and well at all daddy's trying to get his bike down the construction workers put my bike up in the loft here but it's out

with that yeah yeah fast ready ready you don't want to try it tip these years hi my man thank you oh you're good you take care guys when I started this vlog I made a commitment to myself to post every day no matter what there are a lot of questions like what about on days when nothing interesting happens and what about on days when I don't want to make a vlog then there are days like today in today is the first of one of those days that I've had to confront today I'm going to do something personal something that I just have no real interests or I personally don't think it's something that I want to vlog it's not something that I want to share it's nothing that interesting I'm going to visit a family member be with a family member in the hospital I have no desire to bring a camera with me at no desire to sort of share this this is a personal day it's a stressful day it's a scary day so that's it I spent a lot of time thinking about this and thinking what could I share or how could I cheat it and make like maybe a smaller vlog today or do something like that and what I realized is that this whole vlog I feel like the whole relationship that this vlog that I have with you the audience is sort of predicated on a foundation of trust and mutual respect with that I thought rather than trying to cheat or hide the reason why today's vlog would feel less substantial than others just to be totally honest and let you know that it is now eat24 in the morning and this will be the end of today's vlog should be back tomorrow with a regular vlog if not I will have another vlog like this where I explain why I'm not back with the regular vlog this will be the prettiest time-lapse intro of any of my last 92 vlogs ready my friend Ryan is in town this morning from Texas I'm going to meet him to run and he'll be in the vlog more today than just our run he's a really great guy this is Ryan's hotel she's got to find the guy there is Ryan kid run yeah I'll see you soon yeah yeah compliers Sawa's

record the Canadian send the best mail time packages ready thanks Mike okay that's it no times over I've been in a meeting with these guys since like first thing this morning nonstop meeting the reality of that statement Senate I've been staring at your face I'm so sorry it's like watching ten hours worth of your vlogs basically stress well I know you're a fan of the vlogs there as if that nine hour meeting wasn't enough it's an exciting meeting I'm going home now to spend a little time with the fam because we're continuing that meeting tonight over drinks and dinner so I want to get a little bit of family time in before we go out hi where's Candace where are they Candace Frannie huh come home from work early to see the family and there's no family home just an empty house all right after a little cutie with the baby and the fam I have to head to a company dinner taking my bike it's not the whole company at this center but there's gonna be like six or six or seven of us it should be fun there's probably going to be some drinking element involved so I just want to say now ahead of time that if this vlog just abruptly ends with no conclusion to the story it's because the drinking began and then I neglected to continue vlogging I always wonder what's underneath I get to catch this one look entirely of an attendant this is so scary I'm here that's why I went down there don't ever do that today is not QA day but the question I get asked on Twitter the question you asked more than any other question is what kind of gear do you use or what software did you edit that on that is my least favorite question I hate that question the gear never matters my entire career was built on using like a terrible low resolution DV camera editing the video in free iMovie the gear never matters tell a great story teller great story really well and people will forgive whatever gear you shoot it on so ask me about telling stories asking about ideas don't ask me out hardware just google it or such an uninteresting question who woke up extra extra early yes you did she woke up extra extra early okay going for a run I'm accidentally wearing all red white and blue outfit today I didn't do this on purpose but even my headphones back did you know there's a beach not cement hunt bridge sand tranquil waves that place where Batman put his logo in the third installation of Batman

over and have you been watching daily Carly or no I kind of binge watch don't watch daily I watched like five in one day okay okay alright so I just want to make sure you're actually watching yeah the one that I liked the most was where I love that I'm on the spot right now to explain it I just you know in my homework I promise I watched your blog no but I did like the one down st. Barths where where she didn't say okay now you're making me nervous because you're sticking a chair in my face I did hey I give up Sisyphus was this king who wouldn't stop lying so as a punishment for his line he had to push this gigantic boulder up a hill and every time it got to the top of the hill it would roll back down to the bottom and he'd have to roll it back up to the top and then fall down the bottom and he'd roll it back up at the top and that was his life for all of eternity it is a ridiculously beautiful day in New York City today but like every other day I will spend it inside at my desk writing emails I am Sisyphus and email is my Boulder I'm sick I hate being sick morning I don't even know that guy Candice parked on the street last night and needs me to put money in the meter so her car doesn't get a ticket but the money needs to go in the meter 37 minutes ago there's a very high likelihood that she got a ticket $65 I shouldn't be running because I'm sick but I'm gonna do like a quick run to three miles just to start the day off yes three miles at a seven-minute pace what that going for a run is make me feel better it didn't feel dizzy and just generally horrible died finds a little have a nice walk have a nice walk so a lot of people in the comments were asked how I film my runs I actually just used my iPhone which the quality is like astounding that the video is on this stage and then yeah I just stick it wherever so like I don't bring a tripod I just like rest it against a garbage can or thermal lean it up against the curb or whatever there's not a whole lot to it I feel terrible today terrible in today's vlog I want to tell a story tell the story of the studio space and and how it came to be so it was like 2002 maybe two thousand three and I was like 21 years old I just like found my footing in New York City I had a full-time job where I have a really good paycheck and I was hired to direct a candy bar commercial and these weren't just regular candy bars these were Atkins low carb diet candy bars it wasn't a particularly creative job it wasn't like a super awesome gig but is the first like really paid job I had as like a filmmaker and the paycheck for the gig was the paycheck was ten thousand dollars which seems like a whole lot of money you know what ten thousand dollars is a whole lot of money but after I got that paycheck I immediately quit my job it was like a really good really safe job with like lots of potential if someone were to come to me for advice and say I've got this $10,000 should I quit my day job my advice would be no but that's right it I quit my day job I had 10 G's and I started looking for an office space and I came and looked at this building which is in Chinatown in New York City and they showed me a bunch of spaces in my price range my price range was like five six hundred bucks a month can't get much in New York City for that amount of money and the places they showed me had no windows they're really small crappy they were less than what I had hoped for and then they showed me this space if this space was like a 250 square foot box and it's 14 feet by 14 feet but it had these two enormous windows that looked onto Broadway but it was like I think was $1,100 a month but I signed the lease I took the space anyways and after first month last month security deposit and whatever other stupid charges they owe I had to pay like several months in advance because I had terrible credit I was left with enough money to last 30 days to last one month in this space so I was like hustle figure out how to pay next month's rent or I was totally like up creek and on top of all that I had quit my job so I had no real income source it was a major leap of day but it worked out I don't know what the first paying job was but it happened and the rest is kind of history on the space this here is their ghent ik hole you see this was in 2007 when I started production I'm an HBO show and actually had some money we evicted the woman next door and expanded from our little space into this much larger space combining the two making what is now like my production studio I looked through all my old footage and the only the only content I could find of this studio space when it was really raw was the raw footage the unedited footage from a from a commercial shoot that my brother and I did for a fancy totebag company called Jack Spade and to show off the durability of their bags we thought we would fill up one of their tote bags with fireworks and light it off and then show that the bag could withstand the explosion and in the process we accidentally left the entire studio on fire just the disclaimer this was a much younger much more irresponsible casey than the adult married father of two that i am today please do not try this at home Oh it's Tuesday morning tomorrow morning I leave for California I'm going to Anaheim for for VidCon which I've never done before and I'm pretty excited about hey I know you what's up my cat nice to see this morning I think you're on the vlog I've been a little overwhelmed with questions about beam especially on Twitter I appreciate it feel free to keep them coming but I really have come to enjoy the dialogue that is this vlog with you the viewers and I don't want to just be dominated by beam so let's make this QA about something else first let me just give sort of the required apology for that terrible noise you're hearing in the background I don't know it's just general New York City nonsense sorry for the noise okay back the Q&amp;A David asks what's your favorite and least favorite part of your average day favorite part is waking up I love starting the day least favorite part is the battle between life do I leave work early so I can spend a little extra time with the family where I get my work done and then I have to see my family less it's like a lose-lose have you ever collaborated with Candice on any work no I'd like to I just find that like work plus relationships is never a good idea so I try to be supportive but actually like collaborating with her I think might be dangerous Rufus asks when did you stop smoking uh you know I was never a huge smoker I smoked for like a couple years when I was like 22 23 running through an airport as fast as I could to catch my plane and like having trouble breathing and that's not was like smoking is for idiots I'm done and I like I quit then in there and I've never smoked again so he's bad Gabi asks how do I realize what I want to do with my life I literally have no idea and I'm 19 figuring out like your purpose or your passion or your mission in life is really really hard to do I've always said like you should either be realizing your dreams or figuring out what they are figuring out what they are is really hard the best advice I could give to how to figure it out is to keep very very busy and for some people that means going to college for some people that means getting a job for other people it can manifest itself in a million different ways but sitting around trying to figure it out will never yield results Danielle asks what did you think the first time you saw Candice Candice was such a babe when I met her and she was so out of my league so the first thing that I thought when I saw her was like I will stop at nothing to get this girl to like me it was like it was a hard-fought battle that one Michael asks favorite hobby running running is the one thing I'd love to do in my free time more than anything else Dexter asks why don't you bike anymore I live very close to the office walking is literally faster than having to lock my bike up that's all my mom wants to know your favorite place to travel and where you would go that you've never been favorite place to travel unquestionably Cape Town South Africa that's Candace's hometown it's where she was born she's so happy when she's there and it's also like this incredible place on the other side of the planet where would I go that haven't been yet I've never been to China I love to go to China by like ultimate goal as I'd love to go to space which feels like it could happen in my lifetime what would you do if you woke up in the morning you realize that the last 10 years of your life was a dream I get to work Richard asks how does Candice feel about you always being at work honestly it's one of the reasons why I love her so much and why our marriage is the success that it is so far is she's really understanding of my not just of the fact that I have to work a lot but the fact that like my work is Who I am and if there is any threat to that that it would like be a threat to me as an entire person works not something I do work is literally the person is who I am it's my identity and she doesn't want to jeopardize that she's very supportive Candice is great rival asks do you love us us the subscribers love is a strong word I owe you guys the people that watch my blog and the people have downloaded beam and the people that follow me on Twitter I owe like so much of my career to the fact that you've chosen to give your time to spend it with me and the stuff that I made I appreciate that on a level that is indescribable like without the audience for this vlog and everywhere else like I wouldn't have so I appreciate that but I don't really know why like some like social media kids and like vloggers say I love you the audience I love like six people on planet Earth two of them are my children so love is a strong word if I'm going to be really honest with you I wouldn't use the word love it's a deep appreciation for the fact that you're so generous with your time and that you're so honest with me and that you say nice things and the comments below it means so much love okay I got to end this right now I have something I'd like to share with you so I have nearly every means of unnecessary motorized vehicular personal transport systems I have this busted white hoverboard this fully functional black hoverboard this ridiculously fun one wheel hoverboard this self-balancing motorized unicycle but but there's one means of unnecessary human whatever I called it before that I don't have that I really want and that's changing today contained in this box is something I literally wanted since I was a little little tiny boy what's that you got there skateboard motorized skateboard okay I've got a lot of work to do today but yesterday I went the entire day without leaving the office literally and that's gonna be different today so I gotta go check in with the team and then I'm gonna take a quick motorized skateboard office break hey what's up guys okay this is the inaugural ride on the boosted board I think I'm doing it right I did not read the instructions per usual hey it feels pretty good I feel like I must not have charged it because I think the battery is dead don't these things come charge I knew I was using this thing wrong this skateboard has an app that's ridiculous and and I was set to beginner mode I've now moved it into Pro Mode Pro Mode okay now actually go 24 miles an hour instead of 11 whoa that's that okay starting to get the hang of it it's a little on the 2fast side there's truthfully honestly absolutely no need for a staple for a skateboard to go this fast it's literally faster than the speed limit in New York City allows yo Casey nice that you are like my hero oh my gosh hi this thing yes right this all right Matt I will see you in California say

theoretically I could be a grandfather by now bye bye bye bye headed into the office I only have two days in the office this week which is which is stressed so smells like burning in here no but the weight of this of this letter heavy this cost two dollars and 73 cents to send this is an invitation to some party that's crazy this is menu concierge key that's the highest status level they offer these are the best these are to hand out to flight attendants that are extra nice to you other guys in play you this thing sucks but I ordered a better one canvassing the baby on a walk I'm trying to find them I don't smoke so I don't take cigarette breaks at work or sometimes I take family breaks to go see the way Hey ladies have you been doing hey hell's going on in here yeah how's it going guys is that a talking plant bizarre you yeah maybe or maybe you had some jam and your pancakes that was sitting around too long oh man take care okay all right see this monitor here that is my door monitor it captures with on the other side of this door that's the lens that's the surveillance monitor I have kind of a lot of monitors in my studio here's another one this is just outside so if my car's parked out there I can keep an eye on it and then this monitor here is outside that door as well so that's the elevator there I have this gigantic monitor here it monitors what's on the other side of my office door I have these monitors here this one is outside this one is the other office space this is one door this is the other door that's the other office I don't have these because I'm a crazy person it's just I like my office back here where there's no windows and if I have those TV monitors up I always know what's going on if anything it helps me focus what are you guys doing you built this you got excellent drone control vlogs are coming along okay it's a hell of an undertaking it's like adopting a puppy bye guys good luck with your drone these vlogs are like adopting a puppy they're really fun at first and then just a tremendous responsibility today was just like today was a pure workday I had to be in the office all day I had to focus when I was in the office I was running home to help Candice with the baby and I could have filmed all that but I needed to be present so that I had like all these insecurities like well maybe I don't make a vlog today because nothing interesting happened but I think what makes vlogging will make these vlogs true is that it's just what I'm up to no matter how interesting we're not interesting I determined that to be right dynamite bag number one okay late night leaving the office it's like 7:30 now and that Matt Matt and I are going to a dinner meeting no I'm done good to see you dinner's over it was good it was good good see man yeah awesome my salmon was a little undercooked okay it's late but I am finally heading home long day you keep calling man you got it for all the romanticizing I do of New York City there are frustrations there are times living near is really tough and those frustrations are really amplified since we have the baby it's little things like if you want to jump in the car and go to the store you actually jump into a taxicab if you want to go for a walk down the street you're going for a walk on the streets of New York City on sidewalks that are like super densely populated with people you don't know this isn't meant to sound so so negative but it can get frustrating can get tough and it definitely at times leave you like yearning for some some wind that doesn't involve taxi cab exhaust all that I'm in my apartment right now by the way but I record this inside Candis is over here giving the baby a bath what are you guys doing in the bath pretty early on a Saturday morning today we are giving Francine real baby food for the first time ever so Candace asked I run and get my big camera so we can film it which is a great idea but I am realizing that I'm out in public and I'm not dressed to be out public she likes it she does this work Oh shame shut it criminal thing in her mouth today's family day Candice is over there negotiating whether we can or cannot bring a stroller in here hey where's my sister Jordan how'd you find this place Jordan we ordered a picture of margaritas I'm in what are we doing now walking up up where oh my god estimated delivery on June 1st to June 15th stay here okay Candace I have a great idea DSL bells for bikes yes now people get out of does it work hex or the baby like it yes long day out taking a taxi home now finally home after a long day out straight to the tub Candace straight to the top straight to the tub for the baby I hope you have some late night action because we got a babysitter yeah I'm not showering either Saturday night on the town on the vlog I cannot begin to tell you how infrequently we go out and socialize it's not like it's sometimes it's you I go out and socialize all the time okay I can't tell you how to improving Leigh I go out and socialize tonight is a very special occasion and tell the audience what we have planned oK we've got nothing planned so far but we're a block away from our house it's 7:00 p.m. you don't have a baby we got ourselves a movie shoot here do you think those are real cops or actor cops they look like real cops don't go for the guns whoa look at that babe this is a still photo shoot no audio equipment this is where we're going it's called the ear it's called the ear cracks like baker's racks that looks nothing like me how's your night ocular tennis we're leaving this place now so far night out of than the dismal failure resulting to move our eyes a marginal failure then we're a crew can be diesel night like that alright I should do that so this is how our night out and staring through the window but these guys know how'd it go go dancer you know let's go home stop staring what's up Sam you know Monday I think you Monday yeah pretty sure it's Monday I always know it's Monday because you dress up today's Monday back to work day you might notice that this image is slightly bumpier and less smooth than normal that's because today I'm taking these things just regular old feet to work instead of my usual glowing hoverboard it's kind of a disappointing way to start the week nail time everybody loves a tote bag some socks thank you here ewd photography this is the best mail time package to date you win I didn't mean to rip this in half help yourself and if you want some lollipop here's 2 pounds thank you I met these guys in the street yesterday this is Major thank you thank you that might be the most nefarious gift I've been given to date but thank you thank you thank you and yes that's extremely relevant and that concludes an L time for the day Matt has taken advantage of the caramel popcorn how's your snack that there's perfect I'm starving a candied apple with popcorn so glad you're taking advantage God look at my desk finally out of the office I'm in a car now with Matt and we're on our way to a very business II business meeting so I don't think this counts as getting out of the office this is like getting out of my office not getting out of the office we have a business meeting to talk about the new company at a place called bata works which is some sort of startup thing one hour later one hour meeting is adjourned feel like we're up here we should do something right is so nice now all right we're taking a mandatory work break we're going to get popsicles in the High Line the High Line which is like a pretty big tourist thing it's amazing it's the only raised Park in New York City never come up here but it's really special whose steps so why do they call it shaved ice Hey all right great times over leaving the High Line back to the office checks I think that's got it running home for a minute I have to help can just give the baby a bath and then I go back to the office it's gonna be a late night in the office for sure are you reading a book are you reading a book alright now I have to go pick up food for everybody then get back to the office good hey doing I only know how to get it out of one way one day morning today is a particularly big Monday and I'm not just talking about the amount of pizza ate at home for breakfast today we have two new people starting at the company which is a

purchases in my life this has got to be top 10 but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't like a little bit excited about what's contained in this box it's like this mini Segway thing but it's not even a mini Segway thing it's a generic Chinese version of a mini Segway thing the intelligent car balance those words don't even make any sense they clearly were put into a Chinese to English translator and then print it on the box I'm being super gentle and opening this because I have no idea what to expect them here charger thing this is definitely a should have read the directions first sort of situation but I'd like to see if I can figure it out intuitively it was so fun I feel like a lot of magic carpet look alright Alfie maybe you're right but I'm like focused on talking to a camera and my brain has sort of intuitively figured out how to use it it's a little bit like a um whoa whoa it's a little bit like walking like you really want to think it's just your brain automatically knows how to use it this is amazing yeah you guys I got a new toilet you gotta try this thing it's so fast like it like this step - breathe breathe through it you want to shoulder oh my god oh my okay okay

branding around the new company which is super exciting and once we get it to a place where like initial designs I've been sussed out I'm definitely going to have you guys the internet helped me sort of finalize the design which should be awesome ya know you just made my shots so much better [Music] things are so dangerous they really should never they should never ridden outdoors today is a crazy full day in the office the company's coming along like we're getting closer to be able to talk about it then ultimately launching but he definitely highlights for me some larger concerns I have with my ability to keep making this vlog every day and run my company but whatever today I want to tell another story cuz those are like the easiest for me to make I mean I think they're good but it's a lot easier than me like running around all day with the cameras I have to actually work today I just thought I'd do this intro outside to like so it's not just me in my office talking I'm here to lunch with my crew and then tell a story about when it's okay to give up on a project that you've started here's a little teaser it's never okay having an all team lunch right now the team is enormous I don't even know how we're gonna all fit into the same restaurant also I don't know where they are so I'll find them how you doing what's up guys let them cases up nice to meet you I'm Tyler are you going so really late to meet the team and I don't know where they are I think they went to the usual place and are probably sitting on this stoop but I don't know did anybody get me lunch this feels like a summer camp summer camp lunch situation actually I say that but it wasn't as good as yesterday to be honest like I think they need to work there was a special sandwich they didn't work on it you know it was hard to eat it was hard apart it was too much dressing it was overdressed whatever you know I know so enjoy a forever but they need to improve see this this little lip right here this this is so hard to get up I gotta fix that okay let's talk about when it's okay to give up and when to quit sometimes you go out and you shoot all this stuff you have this great idea you come back to edit it and for whatever reason somewhere between beginning the process and finishing it you just throw in the towel it gets the best of us it's never okay there's never like a valid excuse not to finish something that said there are a number of projects that I've started and not finished for example there's this awesome movie here one moment please trying to finish my movie and cannons cameras have a really bad habit of just deciding to stop recording and it just gives you an error message that says movie stopped recording I just lost like a whole bunch of footage that I thought I had shot I can't just get pretty mad at me when I smash things but [Music] okay let me get another camera and get back to my movie all right this this is the 5d Mark 3 this is a much more expensive camera and fancy camera than the one that I just destroyed but watch this is the reason why I destroyed my other camera and this is the reason why I'm about two seconds away from putting an axe through this camera see that it just does that no rhyme no reason it just does that I have the like highest speed memory cards you can possibly look at the speed on that memory card it's the highest speed memory card you could possibly have in there there's no reason for this camera to be critically failing me like this but it is rather than scratching my axe up anymore by destroying this piece of crap I will just finished shooting this vlog on my point-and-shoot sorry for the lower quality I'd also like to go on record by saying don't buy Canon cameras because they will fail you when you need them it is brilliantly appropriate that I'm having this much trouble finishing this movie which is supposed to be about movies that I've had trouble finishing it's like alright so back to the real story this is like this really awesome movie that I started shooting in like 2011 in 2011 there was this crazy snowstorm and we went out like filmed us like look this is just goofing around in the snow ready this is my friend Ariel Schulman over here see him and then I'm on top of the snow mountain in Times Square and he is like ready look at that so we went around doing this snow day and we shot this amazing snow day in New York City movie then to complement this snow movie from four years ago last summer we went out and we shot the same movie like the same snow day movie but we shot during like the hottest day the year we went to Central Park and we were all sweaty and hot there's rel there there's Haley there's Louie who gets started it with us and we like we shot the same movie the same scenes but we shot them when it was super hot out oh this is me doing a backflip there's Haley I love summer um okay and we just never finished that movie I don't know why I've just never finished it now that's like a silly easy movie to not have finished on a much bigger level and this this is why I am making this video it's not because of a stupid snow day movie it's because four years ago now four years ago I went to Afghanistan I went there with one of my closest friends in the whole world a guy by the name of Scott Campbell Scott is a tattoo artist and he and I hatched this plan to to travel to Afghanistan this was the height of the war the height of the surge to embed ourselves with some soldiers in the battlefield and then to just tattoo them and there's a million stories behind this about what it took to get into the country about like how scary it was about how you sneak body armor through Dubai so you can get it into Afghanistan because the DoD won't let you in Denison if you don't have your own body armor and then kind of the best part of the whole story is that we succeeded we actually did it we embedded with Special Forces and we spent a week tattooing these guys there I'm in touch with them to this day I made the movie I made the movie several times I finished it several times I have a doc on my computer right here that's an hour long it's great and I've never released it and it's because I don't consider it done the case with this movie in particular is unique it's the fact that like these guys got hurt over there while we were there Jimmy one of the soldiers was shot in the head while we were there and I have a sense of obligation to these guys to make this something that really captures who they are and what they're doing and I just don't have the confidence in any of my current edits that they do that and even right now I'm working with another editor a friend of mine who I think is a much better storyteller than I am and we're trying to make it the movie that it should be but this is something that keeps you up at night this is a project that I've never finished these are the guys being embedded with here their apparel rescue jumpers from Alaska Alaska 212 that's Roger he is that the guy who was sort of in charge this here this is Jimmy that bandaid on his head is he was shot in the head the day before this picture was taken this is my friend Scott Campbell that's me that's Raj there and they had just taken us up in the helicopter on a mission that's Brandon they're goofing around that's Scott giving him tattoos this is funny this is Aaron one of the pararescue jumpers and he wanted his tattoo on his butt and this is Scott giving him a tattoo on his butt feels like someone's bumping in the needle in the ass over and over again and I kind of liked it I would like to say that these guys the soldiers in the movies they do have an edited version of it that they watch that they love they're thrilled with it I will finish this movie I will release it I'll probably put it on this YouTube channel and honestly as silly as it sounds making this vlog about it has sort of will help move that process forward [Music] I'm on my way home how does this picture quality look this is shot on a new camera I just picked up today [Music] Hey nice to meet you I see you hey what's up I'm Andrew what are you what's up man good to see

super aggressive saying my suitcase was too big and in the end it wasn't it just been to that metal thing that says it has to be smaller than this but she wanted me to unpack my bags and like block the line in front of everyone what's wrong with that woman that's why every week I know the rules anyways I think she's just being rude just to be rude in the end I didn't change anything and everything fit and everything was by the books and they let me on the plane but she was really really rude to me in the end they put my back in the day okay it's fine so why was she harassing me like

your play man awesome just excited to be back in New York Jack I'll see you later safe travel hey doing is that thank you I'll just get out at the corner there that's it thank you sir great to be back in New York you [Applause] there are there are two things in life that I think really define who you are as a person really shaped who you are as a person there's education and there's experience and when it comes to experience there's the kind that you pursue like a trip or deciding to like kiss that girl for the first time or kiss that boy for the first time and then there's the kind of experience that just happens to you like when I got hit by a car and broke my leg and those experiences they they have a huge impact on who you are and they affect who you are for the rest of your life anyways I say it cuz I want to talk about an experience today one that I'm like a little bit I'm a little bit insecure about talking about because I've never really gotten into it before no really anyways this morning I'm running with my friend Lindsey a journalist at the New York Times she's a super awesome girl and she's also a very fast runner there she is there's Lindsay she's coming in fast he's coming in hot sorry I kept you waiting oh yeah awesome it's where we going 12 miles of an 805 pace great run with Lindsay it's fun running with someone else should do that more do it again all right do it again Frannie that's a good step that's a good step good work friends good work high five good work we let the baby cry yourself to sleep it's called self soothe and never easy [Music] [Applause] normally my vlogs are about really happy things and like super uplifting narratives and today I want to talk about something that's Lou that's not happy I want to talk about something that's super scary so I just wanted to give a warning that if you want something that's like happy or chipper like yesterday's vlog that you just rewatch yesterday's vlog because today is not going to be a happy wanted maybe you should skip it [Music] I want to share my September 11th story now I've told pieces of this before in other videos I've referenced this before I've never really gotten into like what that time was like for me personally or what that day was like for me personally this seems like an appropriate forum for that first just like a touch of context I moved to New York City in on June 4th 2001 literally exactly on June 4th 2001 when I moved here I had a three month sublet so in a place to stay for three months after those three months I moved into a friend's couch that was in the financial district that was literally a half a block from the Twin Towers like a friend's sweet apartment and he was broke so I had to stay on the couch on the morning of September 11th I remember a noise just like a crushing noise and I stuck my head out the window like this and I just remember seeing paper falling and then my roommate came running out he turned on the TV and there was no news there was like nothing he's like what is that and there was nothing and then like it came on and it was the first shot of like the building on fire this is before like terrorism was all anyone talked about it wasn't even in my my scope of consideration but I immediately like grabbed my bag grabbed my video camera which was this hold on literally literally this video camera I grabbed it I grabbed it and I ran out the door I remember walking towards the front door of the apartment and my cameras recorded it turned into something that I can only describe as an unbridled fear and confusion and absolute terror so what I saw and I remember this like vivid I could draw you a picture of where everything is located it's so vivid so vivid in my mind was what looked like car parts and they were clearly airplane parts scattered along the street like pieces of parts and then there were and then there were like pieces of along the street and there was a guy there there was like an EMT or something and he just had a stack of sheets this high and he was running around throwing the sheets over that to just cover it I was seeing the sheet hitting the ground and then like red coming through the sheet and I was terrified like I was recording with my camera like this and when that happened like the camera went down and I was terrified and I looked up and the building was burning it above me and then I got on my bike and started right away when I got far enough away from the the towers actually like see them I picked my camera up to film it and I remember I like zoomed it on this shot of all these firefighters just rushing into the buildings like them parking their trucks right under the buildings rushing into those buildings and that is the most haunting memory of that day because there's no way any of those guys survived they're all just rushing in I biked to my brother's apartment I grabbed him and he and I raced to the nearest hospital we were just like people don't need help let's go in the midst of all that chaos looking down what is it 6th Avenue 7th Avenue looking down the Avenue which was my favorite view of the World Trade Center like this long Canyon asked Avenue these huge beautiful towers at the end and I just remember seeing one of the towers fall and I can only describe it as like it looked like CGI it fell and there was like this long spine which was side of the tower just remained it like fell and then this just like poof turned to powder and it so that was my day it's haunted me forever I always said like there's really only three times in my entire life where I remember being scared like truly scared too or when my first kid was born in my second kid was born because that's a terrifying experience and the last time I was really genuinely scared was trying to go to sleep on my brother's floor on the night of September 11th and all you could hear were fighter jets Wow they had Humvees and military personnel outside the apartment because you weren't allowed south of 14th Street unless you had ID and I just didn't know I didn't like the night before I went to bed and I woke up to buildings falling in people dying and now I'm going to bed again what's gonna happen tomorrow and that feeling of terror is very real and has never escaped me here's some of the footage from that from that terrible day see this was when these are the firemen like all rushing in this is me biking through nearby these are all people waiting outside that's a real Trade Center right they're burning that's that's 20 year old Casey scared out of his mind riding my bike up the Westside Highway to get away from get away from the towers and there they are burning don't take this the wrong way I was glad to have been here when it happened can't imagine something like that having happened and having to read about it or see it on TV being here and knowing what that was like he's an experience that I hold great value in okay sorry for having the vlog this part of the vlog would be such a downer for today I felt compelled to share that the reason why I was compelled to share that whole story is I have to go to a fitting or that I put clothes on me today at Conde Nast and their offices are in the New World Trade Center building [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh One World Trade Center two that photo [Music] locked hi this is Casey I'm trying to meet Alison I can't figure out how to get out of your Lobby this Bank so much there this is exactly like the men in black headquarters look at all this amazing clothing I think this is the right idea we found a winner regarding the suit go with blue look so good let's try it with the white right now I'm being fitted for pajamas I want a kung fu champion that's the one where I live for so what's the problem I mean I like to have them I love the flow unit I feel like a Mortal Kombat character I don't look like I'm a good like through our thing thank you for my pajamas see you tomorrow night okay just to make sense of that the Met Gala is Monday night this is my pass for the Met Gala tomorrow night it's some sort of Vogue magazine pajama party which this sounds too fun not to say yes to especially for giving me pajamas that special situation was about I forgot my mom's in town and my sister organized this lunch I feel like such a bad family member right now nice that family you know those days where no matter how fast you ride your bike no matter how brief you keep the meetings there's always behind you can never catch up today [Music] you know most airports are pretty hard to get around my apologies [Music] tell me about your nap that was a nap goodbye join as a breakfast fifi are you ready I'm ready we are having our Saturday afternoon lunch in this really nice restaurant where they don't have skim milk for their lattes so Candice is protesting by going to the restaurant next door getting a latte there and then bringing it back here okay a little update we are switching restaurants Candice took this to a whole new level feel better plus I think Francine liked the music in here [Music] he's dancing [Music] pop I fancy say five I'll see you in 36 hours all right would you say be good how would I be dad I'll be good I hate saying goodbye [Music] I try to only travel when it's for work or when it's for family and this trip is for work thank you sir I don't know if I've ever featured on this vlog the American Airlines secret entrance at JFK terminal so you enter in terminal eight and you would think you go over here or over there but there's this unmarked and fence here it's just a white door that's where you want to go are you doing nice that any ist 80 basic that's me thanks a lot and that's how it works it's amazing yeah how you doing [Music] then the secret entrance also has a secret exit which dumps you right at the front of the security line have a look hey [Music] things are good you didn't get all those something superball okay appreciate it a little something extra for the bar thanks a lot I appreciate it flight boards in seven minutes that gives me five minutes to get the gate and then two minutes to make sure I get to get on the plane first this mess here that's my Play [Music] layover in Phoenix finally arrived two flights later okay thank you bye-bye [Music] are you doing [Music] I don't know if I've mentioned where I am yet it's Saturday night 11 p.m. I'm in Las Vegas and I'm going to bed [Music] I just met hey Venus that hello and I recognized him by his sunglasses to be honest Dayton switches when you advertise one product but then sell another it's generally frowned upon I feel like my vlogs are a little bit of a bait-and-switch see I don't live in like a fun tropical island I haven't been traveling that much really like my life is here in New York City I spend eight hours a day sitting at my computer writing emails and doing conference calls and there's like a lot of consistency which doesn't like farewell for really exciting daily vlog so I can make today interesting and maybe even tomorrow interesting but I do have some general concerns about sustainability anyways here's my first vlog from New York City it's about a 655 in the morning I'm going for a run I shot this on my cell phone so sorry about the terrible clauses heading to Brooklyn this is the halfway point in my run I'm super super far from my house right now this right here that's the island of Manhattan this right here that's the Statue of Liberty and I'm way out this is called okay now I'm gonna turn around and run home I like to run as far away from my house in one direction as possible and then turn around that way it's really it's really hard for you to cut the run short people has asked how I get those shots not that complicated I stick my iPhone into a chain-link fence which makes a great tripod I run back I turn around I run back and grab my phone back to the vlog okay that concludes this morning's run ten point six miles of a 743 pace left freezing cold shower to chase still freezing normally I ride my bike to work but I can't seem to find my bicycle so I've been walking with you and this is with the majority of my life Jackie M oh yeah my friend Oscar just finish up a movie then that key I've been helping with it hasn't working on for a

and that's my grandmother this is like the first year that Candis is in this photo series because we had been broken up before that and that's my little brother pretty badass this is like when the beach house was in its prime Candace was a cheerleader in high school we had to get into a huge fight because Candace didn't want to put on her bathing suit in the middle of February I think this Mary Poppins theme was Candace's idea this is when we had a big family reunion here what's up oh one here in your underwear and that's it for that photo series I think I stopped in 2012 or 2013 I don't get sad for my birthday or holidays for the new years it's the end of summer that really hits me today's the last summer day which whatever I bought this house like eight years ago and when I bought it it was probably the biggest accomplishment of my whole life like having a home for owning me for the first time ever he's going to college next year I'm selling this house which means this is our last summer here so it's especially sad you know that's it that's my nostalgia Brandon you were supposed to fall asleep you're supposed to take a nap not play with your brother hi puppy hi are you doing what did you do don't do that I put a break up and I went down to get all my stuff mom goes it's rolling it's rolling and it rolled in see crash into Owens car I didn't crash it's just that monster touched this little baby and then it may have been what was the one thing I said to you before you left I said don't crash my car and instead you crash into Owens car the poor kid this car is like 15 years old did you do this - did you tell his boy yet yeah he didn't seem upset at all did you damage the Jeep yeah don't try to blame this on the car I've never done that in any of my dad's cars that had two standard gears I didn't crash your car I did not crash your car well do you realize this might be the last summer day of the house ever ever oh that's a lot of summer day you don't seem

remember vividly getting my first paycheck for like 30 bucks and it really like it blew my mind because it was the first time I was able to connect a dollar with work or with energy and that would be without a doubt one of the most valuable lessons I would ever learn in life very early I'm gonna try to get a quick jump on the day by mowing the lawn nothing freaks the neighbors out quite like mowing your lawn at 7:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning look ass you ready you ready to go up breakfast we're having breakfast with your grandmother and you're on do you haven't met her yet no fussing no fussing silent that's a good girl can I locked up we made excellent timing leaving the house now yes why don't have any clothes on you can't just wear a bra to breakfast you know I just gotta go with the flow I guess our European it is very European it's very exotic alright I bet the way is an hour nice butt crack I didn't even ask well I still asked what does it look like in there well the line is wrapped like this my mom was out all family event and my mom flat Margo by that is there now we're at the store buying things we don't need what are you doing awake go back to sleep go back to sleep go to sleep 8:00 go to sleep am I paying for this do you want anything Owen today's Owens third day of work at his new job I'm very excited about it I am definitely more excited that the kid has

to say you're doing a very good job back there so proud of my boy doing a great job over goodbye thank you for my doughnuts is it weird that it kind of makes me want to cry a little bit what a great boy anyways if he's not in the vlogs not much anymore because he's a working man now eight or donuts and been up since five so I'm falling asleep at the wheel Candice is gonna drive gonna have one more donut this means I've eaten five donuts five dollars I'm gonna drive his canvases flawlessly we did this rotation like five times per from you thanks we're back in New York City finally I think we spent more time driving that we did in Connecticut I'll be back just gonna run to the office super fast and then grab my gear jump on my bike super fast and head out to Williamsburg Brooklyn to get some shots because these low clouds are amazing packing up here for the shoot tonight there's the steed but first stop here Williamsburg Bridge pretty amazing Sun coming through these beams here in both directions this is the view I'm after now it's not as easy to get as you think see this whole bridge shakes so much when the subway goes by that all the shots are blurry the subway there's a camera there so wait you rode all the way back up here nice to meet you pleasure so that's like that's mega wide and this is my new Samsung s6 edge which has an insanely good video camera on it my cameras are just about batteries so I'm gonna get the hell out of here now probably about 20 minutes from here to my thirty nine o'clock I haven't even started editing so be a long day you'll pop it up there is new morning new day new camera new microphone let me know how it how it sounds no dollar pizza today oh thank you so it has probably been the busiest day at the new company since I started the new company with that it's also the first day I've literally done no vlogging whatsoever and right now it's 5:17 p.m. what I did do was earlier in the day Candice and Owen stopped by why'd you have a fight with the post hole she showed me the ugly stance and I said no the pretty ones the flowers right this is all we have I've never had a problem with postal employees in fact I said if I didn't usually probably want to work in a post office you'd be the most miserable postal employee in the history of post offices perfect right and Candice like yanked my camera out of my hand and was like I want to film I want to film you have to be strong to hold this thing so I gave her a camera of her own and I asked her to shoot the vlog today take this camera take Owen oh shoot the vlog just hold the camera steady that's the most important thing no shaky camera okay go shoot the vlog my microphone broke so I'm sorry the sound is so terrible I'm headed home now I did not shoot a vlog for today it's all riding on whatever Candice did or probably didn't shoot honey did you shoot the vlog for me I can't or died so you didn't shoot anything I shot a little bit is it usable that's my only vlog for the day oh okay today might be the first day ever with no vlog huh okay I knew this was gonna happen alright goodnight oh you like this is that cool do you see yourself okay goodnight honey goodnight honey your cry it's bedtime mail time did you press that yep it's mail time let's see what we've got spoonies thank you Oh little converse for free an e-mail times over bye guys well this should be interesting all right back to work so - 15 13 - 13 waiting for the baby get up beautiful day documenting our walking pretend this is a time-lapse yeah I know that yeah I know of it hey even smile yes today we are going to meet some of Francine's friends who I have never met before pretty exciting baby brothers yeah baby friends nice water Oh liar going on some sort of date you want to go get food get food okay the kid and I are gonna you ate some noodles at kellian ping I don't know zeiten you have a problem with that yeah you don't want to eat there uh it's great there I give dinner seven out of ten you same yeah feels good that's two sevens out of ten that's 14 out of 20 it's late our dinner dates over we got Candace some cupcakes heading home now that's really it I thought she would have shot more footage than that if you want to give this a thumbs down for being too boring I totally understand tomorrow we'll be back to our normal logging style Candace has been fired Oh let's talk about copycats let's talk about ripoff artists people who copy your original ideas and then pass them off as their own people who hide behind this idea that they were inspired by your work but actually just steal it wholesale I believe in inspiration ah my work is inspired by filmmakers I look up to like like Verner Herzog and Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick and Wes Anderson and if you look closely you can see that inspiration in my work I'm not talking about that I'm talking about wholesale theft the thing about being original about original ideas is that it's about looking internally what motivates me in finding ideas there the thing about theft is that you cheat you just look at what somebody else is doing and say I'll just do what he's doing and I'll pretend that was my own idea the really tough part about that is how hard how much work it takes to be original how much how much brainpower how much consideration it takes to make sure you're coming up with ideas that are truly your own just to have them ripped off just to have them stolen and it gets really frustrating when they're stolen by people that have big followings so a lot of their followings don't know that this work was stolen there's certainly no credit there and it's painful you can copy the mechanics you can copy a style you can copy an aesthetic but ripoff artists can never emulate the heart the heart behind telling a great story the soul behind something that actually moves or affects people in an emotional way so there's that copycats ripoff artists keep original people on their toes because what it means is if you want to stay original you need to stay way way ahead of the curve you've got to stay so far out there that the rip-off artists are just chasing you down and they will never actually catch up I hope this isn't starting today's vlog from like a negative or aggressive place I'm just frustrated and I feel I need to share that frustration with you thank you for listening also I really I don't say this to discourage anyone from creating anything I would just always check yourself and ask yourself are you copying someone are you thinking for yourself and if it's not the latter maybe rethink your process a good rule of thumb is this if you're constantly being told that your work is a copy of someone else's you're doing it wrong and if you're constantly being told that your work is being ripped off by someone else you're probably doing it right it's a lovely sunny day in lower Manhattan I'm running to Brooklyn that's 11.1 miles in a 727 pace great day for a run hey Candace pool yeah I know it's warm out today I just want to remind you you're a mom and I think the short skirts like that I mean it was too short bye Candace gasps is showing ah I don't know who sent this to me but thank you I'll be back in 25 I have a meeting this morning with my friend Carly Carly is a businesswoman she's also an investor in my new company she also was about to start a YouTube channel that I'm helping her with she's also a supermodel but she hates it when I call her that only on my skateboard right here I ripped a hole in the crotch of my games never skateboard in tight jeans Carly has a gold Apple watch Carly did you spray-paint that or that uh that is pure solid gold baby that's pure actual gold there if you want me to spray paint it silver I'll do that for you very generous of you are you getting a taxi and I you Karlie Kloss I'll see you later bye Carly back to the grind cobblestones sorry I have a super interesting meeting right now for my wedding Candace's parents got me a Rolex I never wore it so I hated how heavy it was for my birthday and escabi just sweet like sports fan for the Rolex and last week it broke and I dropped the watch I caught it on camera anyways the guy who makes this band saw that on the vlog he flew to New York to rectify the situation this is the meeting I'm about to walk into what's up what's up guys nice watch yeah they fixed it and just had it fixed but this is the one that broke and look now the top one is giving way don't worry we're gonna fix everything oh good attitude yeah okay so you're the person who did this install the wrong one yeah put the wrong one in so it's glad I even came by hacks I would totally spray-paint this a different color I think Candace would divorce me so we found the culprit look at that busted corkscrew of a pin that's why it broke but Candace he just took apart my bed and he said that your guys put the wrong pin in but that's okay it happens you don't have to yell at me alright we're gonna get back to work you're Candace I'll teach you ttyl Tiki Tiki Oh Jeff wanna show these guys your watch smile ooh watch Jack got a pink Apple watch today manliest

see you man I love those guys I love this guy what is it he's cute just dumped a garbage can over and then these guys are picking it up I mean come on we live here protests happening on Broadway we're watching from the apart well I'm watching it from the window it's freezing and it's raining out fine all right I'm going running this morning with my friend Scott Campbell he's the person I traveled to Afghanistan with where we tattooed a bunch of soldiers in the middle of the war I also made a movie about him which I'll link right here looks got up he's a really amazing brilliant artist and a super interesting guy Scott Campbell good to see you sir about our once a year run yeah are you breaking out here yeah do you good to see you alright guys I'll talk to you soon good again tomorrow all right that was just under seven miles at a six um 651 pace great to see Scott here's the thing I don't even want dollar pizza right now I literally don't not hungry I don't want dollar pizza but I happen to have four quarters in my hand which are really annoying in my pocket so really it's just more of a pragmatic decision than a diet r1 or something out of hunger what's up man myself with you well pizza right yeah I have something to admit here why don't you get me so I have been getting dollar pizza for breakfast almost every day for the last four months it's really good it is so it is so hard not to complain about the weather when it's like this outside see there's like this there's like this unspoken deal that you have here in the Northeast that you put up with like the terrible freezing cold winter so when June 2nd rolls around it's warm outside and it's been like 55 degrees in raining poor little Francine we had to put her in her winter jumpsuit today okay it's q8 ah there's something I want to show you okay in like 2002 or 2003 have this gigantic pickup truck and I was also really into tap dancing at that point in my life so I have this license plate made this is the real my real license plate my friend Keller just found this and sent this to me so that says it says tap mother all right okay now it's actually Q&amp;A time I was watching last week and it seemed kind of annoying that like I'm always staring at my phone so I'm bringing my laptop back so I can just glance at my laptop then answer your questions questions questions questions Nicole asks how do you get yourself out of a rut work work is the answer to a lot of problems it cures depression heartbreak all those things you just when you're in a bad place I bury myself with work the progress and the physical activity and the brain distraction it like breaks me out of anything Silas wants to know how would you suggest that one earns money for camera gear get a job how does anyone earning you work sorry that was like me get a job chin wants to know why is Malcolm X a hero to you Malcolm X is like is my hero because the guy went to prison as a total degenerate as a proper criminal he deserved to go to jail and while in jail all he did was educate himself and when he came out he came out as this great strong maybe one of the greatest communicators of the civil rights movement in him being like this I think the sort of quintessential autodidact is something that's tremendously inspiring for me because you know I'm a high school dropout I never went to college I never went to school and when I was younger a gigantic insecurity of mine was my lack of education and looking at someone that had impact on this world as tremendous as Malcolm X and realizing that he he also didn't have an education he just he took it upon himself to educate himself that's moving for me and that's all without getting into the actual impact that he had in this world and what he did which is which is tremendous but I identify with him personally because of that journey BIRT wants to know and this is like Bert from Bert and Ernie his avatar is Bert can you tell us anything about your new business is it a product or is it a service uh it's it's an app we're building an app it's awesome and as I've said like a gazillion times I promise to get into every single detail of what we're doing as soon as I can on this vlog this vlog will be like the mouthpiece the loudspeaker for for what we're making just not yet I still like that King patent application still hasn't been filed and there's like near yet other concerns that are like gumming up us talking about it but soon I promise I like this question Bosco wants to know divided into percentage these factors to reach success natural talent luck and determination natural talent is highly overrated it's determination determination determination and then like luck and all that other education all that's like it's not even the same PyCharm cat this sim kathy san Katzen cath it katha sin' do you want your son to follow your footsteps no I just want the kid to be happy I'm very happy I just wanted to find happiness and what however that might manifest Lisa Lynette do you have any major insecurities I don't know maybe maybe not I'm too busy for insecurities like they're just a distraction if I do have any I've ignored them for so long they've gone away Soren brine Holt honest question why are you always wearing sunglasses ah because when you're cool the Sun shines on you 24 what's it because when you're cool the Sun shines on you 24 hours a day what movie is that from why do you wear sunglasses at night because when you're cool the Sun Shine on you 24 hours a day we Louis Michael Morgan who looks like he's about 13 years old asks are you an ass or boob kind of guy well Louis that's not a very nice question but if I had to answer and I mean this it's like the prettiest girl in the world really stops being pretty if she's not interesting the flip of that is like a super interesting girl is attractive no matter what she looks like so I don't know why I think Candace is such an outrageous babe just she's like funny and fun and holds my attention and I love hanging out with her bastard ah Cameron wants to know what do you think about going to college ah this is more of like a universal answer about college or life in general but it's like the path you take to success or happiness in life can have a gazillion different manifestations I dropped out of high school in the 10th grade and like went on welfare and got a job washing dishes because I had to I had to support my my baby like I had no other options but that is what led me to what I'm doing today I couldn't have predicted that and I think that what college is really incredible for is if you don't know what to do college can be a really great place to find that and that's not just the academic aspects but also the social aspects being around new people like living away from your parents house being exposed to all the sort of different cultural aspects of being a melting pot that is like that is a college but I also think that the price of college is insanely expensive and before you drop a couple hundred thousand dollars on it on school you know money is fungible like how else could you spend that money and what will take you further in life but in general I have I have nothing bad to say about education in any capacity okay I get to stop finally that is whether the same I monitor that was like 19 minutes of questions and I just edited down to however long it is right now so I do these these two days are like they there I do a lot of them I just try to cut it down to make interesting state o'clock I'm heading home it's still raining it's been raining for 72 straight hours the entire state of California has no water and it's been raining here for 72 hours my tire you you look tired not really 7 8 9 11 interruption ten hours of sleep is a lot of sleep I don't think so are you excited for Monday good to get back to work yeah I'm excited really yeah bye I really like Candace okay Monday morning full week in the office it's freezing outside it's still Fashion Week judging by these girls outfits have a bunch of new ideas for YouTube let's talk about it first to realize these ideas I needed some new gear new gear that is six new GoPros one of these things and this contraption you see I borrowed a 360 rig to make that crazy 360 video yesterday and then I just went nuts and bought all the gear so I can build my own 360 rig that's what's happening here I don't really have anything else to say about that I just want an excuse to shovel to show off all these GoPros I did not get these for free by the way I paid for these they're expensive ok so I hope you're looking forward to some serious 360 stuff 360 stuff coming up soon the trouble with mondays is that I'm always

I trust your literary suggestions big time running homes quickly because I forgot a cable there also Candace's mom is watching the baby this week because Candace is out of town so I'm going to check

that you're dealt okay ready for my meeting drop pig once again good man good man got my camera got my keys all as well so Candace has gone for the next like seven days for work I'm alone with the baby her mother is here helping me with the baby so the vlog might get really boring for the next week because I'm on full-time daddy duty that vlogs like four minutes long and it still took me until after midnight to finish took a while to get the baby go to bed I paid my taxes you know nothing this should be green it's not mine man today's vlog is kind of a special vlog I'm the collaboration with a youtuber who I sort of know I like his stuff should be interesting not sure what to expect okay YouTube just bear with me here feel my pain for a second I'm doing this collaboration today and I have this brilliant idea shooting a 360 boosted board race because I got two of these junks through Central Park and this is going to be the first time that I use my new insane 368 K rig but I've been spending the last like many many hours trying to figure out how to work this disaster of a contraption if you don't have a PhD in astrophysics and like another PhD in computer science you have no chance of figuring out how to work this nightmare I think I'm gonna have to put this in a box and ignore it until I can find someone to actually operate it for me look at this thing that guy Joe no you look at this camera looking for I could even say oh oh alright let me let me introduce you here Jesse this is Jesse here Jesse is like one of the original gangsters when it comes to daily vlogging he was doing this like what five years ago like five years yeah he's been doing this for five years he's been doing this forever he definitely was one of the people that like genuinely kicked off the daily vlogging movement on all of YouTube this guy's changing the game of vlogging right here the quality is inspiring it kills me I'm like when I watched her vlog Stacey I'm like oh my god I need to I need to step my game up man he's changing the game you're gonna be the top blogger I'm pretty sure I paid him I'm gonna be chasing I'm gonna be chasing him what's your confidence level on this I'm pretty confident I'm pretty sure I could stay up with you but like you know the streets you're nuts dude holy shit I thought I was crazy forget about this Volvo guy had a duck truck and he was moving I was all God that was scary so Jesse this is sort of the equivalent of like New York City's electric skateboard Autobahn there are no lights you ready see these boosted boards they are the greatest creations but they only go about eight miles between charges and at full speed 24 miles an hour eight miles is exactly 20 minutes I always see like people charging their cellphone on this outlet so I'm hoping I can just juice here for a minute Jesse this doesn't worked so now we ride gently to try to get enough power to get us somewhere to charge I recognize a skateboard before I saw you careful man you're losing some beer yeah right all right it's been an hour sitting at this terrible restaurant I told Jessie I wouldn't vlog in the taxicab but we didn't want to run out of batteries before we got to Central Park for a 360 race so we're taking a cab to Central Park we got those skateboards in the food what's happening right now we're gonna shoot a 360 video we're in Jesse and I race our boosted boards around Central Park I'm shooting on 360 so I'm not going to be vlogging this jesse is going to be shooting behind the scenes would that be to Yash ug so go check it out on his channel Shiva selfie stick this looks like a Swiffer Sweeper the mops tomorrow thank you give me way better than I thought it was going to be I didn't shoot any footage while we were doing that so I really wanted to focus on the 360 Jesse shot a whole bunch we're going to head downtown now and we're going to take Fifth Avenue during rush hour which is pretty terrible idea this is Fifth Avenue no where are you okay stay put I'll be right there there is fucking dead man dude I thought I loved you ready Jessie thank you so much sir today was awesome behind the scenes for the 360 checked out Jessie's Channel we just were photo bombed by that person thank you let's go can we yeah yeah that's good yeah okay I'm just an analyst log right there we'll see y'all later hey guys that's just my cat giving cuddles I think you guys should follow me on beam because I've got a super cute cat and I'm an Irish girl and I'm living in Dublin but I travel the world with my fashion blog so I hope you guys follow

I look like Robert De Niro in his prime know how much Sean Connery for sure Monday morning back in New York City things are sorted back to normal very happy to be back here VidCon was amazing and a super fun time met a lot of people but starting to freak out so I missed the baby in Candace in the office I go away for two days and this is what happens I really wanted to make sure I have some time today to talk about VidCon and what a crazy experience that was but they just told me that I have a borderline obscene amount of mail over here so good god so it looks like today might be a mail time episode thank you for what might be the creepiest thing anyone's ever sent me I mean I don't mean to be ungrateful but this is going to give Francine nightmares Boris thank you for my alien heads Thank You Riley Bennet for this gigantic selfie stick I was just about to say thanks for the dog food I'll feed it to Gigi try prefer human food and then I saw this tiny little package of gummy bears

stones Oh gonna use the knife but I'll be very careful I don't know how else to get through this hi Casey hope you're having a kick-ass week I Congrats on launching beam thanks will will you know the way to get my attention this box is all beaten to hell these are the scariest packages all right this is from my friend Zack Zack loaned me his skateboard in Dubai and then I was being towed behind

t-shirt whoa cool check out that bean sticker and that's pretty awesome okay check this kid out go to his YouTube because he sent me this and this is awesome Thank You Dustin you're a good man so yesterday Jack had this brilliant idea that we should go get double cheeseburgers with cheese fries milkshakes and that's exactly what we did and they were delicious but I've been feeling pretty sick ever since I don't really eat much food like that and today to rectify the situation I'm eating like super healthy raw vegan plant-based foods and I'm gonna go get like a kale salad or something right now and it just seemed like a great opportunity to take out the boosted board look at these yo what's up guys hey see I've been here since he's been here since 11 o'clock oh you're in the vlog I wish I'd known you guys were here to come out say hi all right guys nice to meet you you're all probably in the vlog unless I cut this scene six hours of waiting in it I'm so sorry that you waited for six hours shame those kids have been waiting outside my office for six out it's a red light for six hours man poor kids I feel like such a jerk what so part of the reason why I'm going on this Odyssey to get some raw vegan healthy overpriced food is its 704 and the p.m. and I have not left the office since I got in it like 8 o'clock this morning so I'm forcing myself to leave the office once before it gets dark out okay thanks a lot okay so this is like a fruit and hemp raw drink which is like okay these are rock health noodles they're not as bad as they sound but they're not as good as a double cheeseburger speed my 40 friends like it's time I said hi you breakfast it is just after 6:00 in the morning I've been up since about 5:00 after 3:00 finishing yesterday's vlog which is exporting

and 54 minutes just waiting out my uber now I really would prefer to skateboard to the garage to get the car to drive the airport but skateboarding with this suitcase like 20 blocks just doesn't seem

I'm driving here I'm posting yesterday's vlog using my phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot in my laptop and I just dropped this camera and it landed on my laptop and shattered the screen totally broken so that sucks I guess it's time to get a new computer I've had that one for a whopping three months there's something almost poetic about dropping you're about smashing you're vlogging computer with your vlogging camera it's like they were in cahoots to rebel against me hi I'm on the freeway now plane takes off in 54 minutes I'm feeling good pulling in T airport now 28 minutes before the plane takes off I'm good how you doing I've got a tail number for you is that our plane no no no no planes all the way out there so this is I broke the computer we have arrived in Marfa Texas bye guys thanks a

gonna skateboard there this times actually not bad for skateboarding there's only one stoplight in the entire town that's incredible the other bonus about skating in Marfa Texas there are no Hills

thrower you know they miss Saugus took Francine out for Chinese she is not abused you want some chow mein 740 in the am heading into the office early today there's a problem at the new company it's like the technical thing it's not interesting it's not critical and I'm going in early to address it what's up guys morning Casey nice dad carefully ah come in join me yeah ladies and gentlemen this is Sarah Sarah works with the new company she's our head of business operations it's true have you ever been on camera before not intentionally why don't you pick the questions to ask me for today's Q&amp;A this is a special edition Q&amp;A featuring Sarah all right okay here we go pick good questions all right let's ah smart questions all right Casey what is your favorite quote okay it's in the foreword to a book called Hertzog on Hertzog and the quote is something like don't quote me on this it's something like never have a plan B people with a plan B will invariably fall back on it that's why they have it in the first place it's good right yeah let me know let me know in the comments below doing like these tandem cuties are good or if they're boring I mean no no offense to Sarah where do you see yourself in 10 years time Kippy honestly I never look more than like maybe a year and a half in the future are you looking forward to VidCon Casey VidCon I'm gonna be at VidCon this year I have no idea what to expect yes I'm looking forward to it yeah come say hi at VidCon yeah come say hi well be there you're gonna come sure why not I'll take a hoverboard ah how do you find being a YouTube filmmaker different than being a real filmmaker real filming that's that's a good question the question is what's the difference between being what is known as like a traditional filmmaker and being a youtuber and that is when you make regular films you are beholden to external forces to get that scene or distributed what that means is like I'm a traditional filmmaker I make my indie film or my Hollywood film and then there are studios there are people there are agents there are all these avenues standing between me and the audience and when you're a youtuber you make the decision when the work is done and then you just upload and you share it to your audience and that's a really big deal and that's why I think YouTube and distributing on the Internet is a way that you're deal and show you a movie in a movie theater there's no nepotism here people watch your stuff online because they like it what will you do if your new company isn't as successful as you want it to be well you don't need a new job I will be out of a job so we'll be problem together if the new company isn't as successful as I hope is as I imagine it will be if the new company fails I will immediately start over and start another company that's what you think because that's what you do how is your style evolved over the years let me add to that do you do you try and evolve your style of videos do you think it's important I think it's important to get better so there are filmmakers that literally just keep doing the same thing over and over and over but they get better every time Wes Anderson he does the same thing over and over and over but each film is such an evolution of the prior film because change is easy but getting better is is really hard do you regret any of your talk to do you get bored no and the reason why I don't get bored is because there's always a list whether it's like in my head are literally on paper I'm sure you're the same way things that need to be done so anytime there's like free time that would be occupied by boredom you just have their stuff to do there's work to do do you ever get bored I do but it's my own fault if I'm bored I gotta change it up yeah yeah it's time to change okay Emily you know this is you not doing your job oh excuse me from Emily Volpert thank you for writing an m' label print how will you be marketing your new company this vlog for starters this vlog is where i'm going to talk about the new company that was like the main reason why i started this vlog but mainly like through other social media and i like to think that like the new company what we're making is something that everybody is going to love so we're counting on the people that use it the people that like it to spread it around we're not going to be doing TV commercials we're not going to doing like billboards or banner ads or what other really annoyingly marketing is there out there yeah like like paid tweets yeah we're I can do any tweet he'll be notated no paid tweets alright I think we have to stop it there when will you tell us about the new company soon soon yeah there's all these new company questions will the new company be something people will use on a daily basis hope so hope do I pay attention to timing while editing videos timing is everything when editing videos ok we're going to stop there thank you for all of your tweets if I didn't ask you here's a mini plug for you ok tune in next Tuesday for more questions with Casey and Sarah although it's probably just gonna be Casey next week thank you for coming by ok come on man only Hill per second apparently inhaling outside right now it never hails in New York City is inhaling something that's like hail but it's a heritability you guys need to go outside like they can go for a pee whoa wait hell yeah I thought I saw him and that's it party's over how disappointing hail storm is over going home thank you funny goblak once you go black ain't coming back it's a rap Jack go blind alright bud and don't forget running with my friend Ben this morning then is a faster better gooder runner than I am so he keeps me on my toes in a really big way he and I are meeting at the apex of the Manhattan Bridge and I'm late all right I am now at the apex of the Manhattan Bridge no sign of Ben I guess I will simply keep running and you'll find the man it is indeed it's Ben which when we go and Brooklyn in their hand if you want then Hatton or Brooke let's kill Brooklyn go let's go let's go then I'm putting you in my blog this morning I was explaining the viewers that you were a far superior runner than me awesome and you keep me on my toes right keep it honest gotta keep Dallas he's so fast I'll see you soon good run ten miles at a 7:59 pace lovely lovely run this morning we got any water cup got a new cup you got a new cup show me how it works how's it work there you go today is Q&amp;A day let's do a little experiment and watch how quick I get questions after I do a tweet okay three more this is why I missed so many people's questions every refresh is like 50 more questions John wants to know who you love more than anything to get a compliment from you know John I have a rule and that is to ignore praise and embrace criticism so I'm really not I never try to seek compliments it's generally a dead end this is kind of a ridiculous question but Ben wants to know Casey how do you live so philosophically I don't really know what you mean by that but I try to pay attention always I pay attention to everything I read everything I hear everything I see and then I ignore about 99.9 repeating percent of that and whatever is left over I hang on to for dear life and I think this philosophical living that you're speaking of is just me sort of sharing the aggregate of what I've absorbed over the course of my life she wants to know if you have a chance to travel more where would you go and why she I have so many opportunities to travel right now and it pains me to but I say no to all of it I have two priorities right now family and my new company and if travel doesn't fall into one of those two categories I say no no wants to know what's your advice to kids struggling in school just like anything else in life this too shall pass Josh wants to know what's the craziest way you've broken a camera probably with a gigantic rock smashing the camera like this on the side of the Zambezi River on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe but I had a critical failure exactly what I needed the camera it had to be destroyed when will Karlie Kloss upload her first youtube video okay I'll let Carly do the talking here and I will do a whole vlog before she launches her YouTube channel just know Carly class on YouTube is going to be awesome why does Owen work in a donut shop why don't you get him a cool job okay let me spend a little bit of time picking this one apart so my son Owen has his first job right now he works at a Krispy Kreme donut place at the cash register selling people Donuts which is a tough job and yes I could make a phone call and I could get him some cushy easy fun cool job and like a production company doing something totally awesome but I'm his father and I try to do what's best for him at all times and what's not good for a kid to have as his first job it's something cushy and cool beyond learning the value of a dollar and Beyond learning what the suck means of working in a place like that he will forever for the rest of his life no matter how successful or rich or famous he might become he will forever treat people that work behind the counter with a level of respect that they deserve because he will appreciate and understand how hard that job is that's one of the reasons the bigger reason two days ago three days ago I did a whole vlog about sort of life's principles and what it means to always fixate on what do you want from life and then figure out how to execute that and a lot of people asked a lot of people replied with what's the best way to find your passion what's the best way to find your calling in life and I'd have an answer to that and I don't know that this answer is right but this is an answer I firmly believe in the best way to find what you love in life is by doing something you hate a cushy job a cool job a job that you like is is comfortable that comfort breeds complacency and that complacency breeds stagnation so you just kind of stay there fine job even though it may not be your dream or your passion and then all kinds of happens she gets pregnant you buy a car there's a mortgage payment you have a house you have this cushy life and before you know it you have these handcuffs these golden handcuffs that is your day job that you didn't love you never loved it was just an easy job but now there's no way out of it and all of that happens by doing something that's cushy and easy if you get a job that absolutely sucks something you hate doing you will spend every minute on the clock fixating and fantasizing about what you wish you were doing where did I find my passion for filmmaking and my drive to do what I do in life I found it in the bottom of the nastiest burnt up clam chowder pot ever working a seafood restaurant where I'd have to dig so deep into that pot to scrub the bottom you know get all over my arms and all over my shirt and I just reeked of stale seafood and it never came off my body but doing that for years fifty hours a week every week for like five years really galvanized for me what I wished I could be doing I fantasize about having a job that I loved about doing something I was super passionate about about working for myself and not having some total boss telling you what to do all the time I obsessed over it but if I had been some cushy some sweet some fun job that my dad got for me none of that Drive would have been there so yeah Owen works in a donut store and what he will get from working in a donut shop what he will get from a Shay job is invaluable and he might not appreciate that and whoever wrote me that comment might not appreciate that but believe me at some point in his life he will look back and he will see that that was one of the most influential jobs he could have ever had I hope otherwise he'll hate me forever for making him work in a donut store okay that's it for QA I have a photo shoot in this office in like 45 minutes it should be kind of fun and I will vlog about it this photo shoot is happening now hi I'm Casey Jake okay Renee and I need what are we doing today you

you're not in the vlog it's not by accident Dean is single and we're looking for a girl for him needs a wife she needs to be what two or five foot seven or a husband I know much whatever you're into gene cute Oh welcome to New York City Fred move long day we're back home baby's asleep she's asleep Kathy back I wanted to sneak away from the house for a minute and go to the studio well and walk the dog I wanted to go to the studio for a second and just talk about my feelings about the Apple watch this isn't like a formal review this is just I would call this like Apple watch initial impressions dink super fast update I got an Apple watch like a day and a half ago a lot of people have asked me on Twitter and in the comments below how I like it this is just let me begin by saying I have this like crazy Louboutin custom watch band made by these guys in Montana the watch band is incredible I'll link these guys below they didn't pay me to say this about them this is not like a paid endorsement but it's a brilliant handmade leather watch band and they make a million different styles and they cost like less than a lot of apples watch bands so I'm psyched to have supported like two American craftsmen rather than supporting like some Factory in China initial thoughts on the watch itself and I'm going to say the good first and then the bad so before you call me a fanboy just like watch this whole thing through first the good this sounds a little ridiculous but it's a really good watch like it feels good it's heavy I like the way it looks and like when I look at my watch it tells me the time and that sounds like menial but that's a really big deal that all the technology doesn't get in the way of that so it's a good watch - the only thing I really use it for is text messaging and for that it's amazing it's really really good ahh 3 what also I like about it let's see I like the way it looks I like text messaging I like how it tells me what time it is and then just little stuff like skipping songs when I'm at the gym besides that I don't really know what else I like about it but I do like it and I can see that it's going to get good ok now the things that I don't like about it there are a lot of nonsensical inconsistencies in this thing let me try to show you on the watch it so I say it has these nonsensical inconsistencies because ok you swipe up and it has all these like quick they're called glances quick access apps here but the one app I use the most text messaging I can't put here ok that doesn't make any sense second of all when I'm deep in an app and I'm like done with my timer here there's no button I can push to make it go back to a clock I have to push this button and then this button and then this button and then I'm back here that's kind of ridiculous um another thing is like when I'm in text messages I can scroll this little scroll wheel and it lets me go through all my text but when I'm in mail no amount of scrolling does anything I have to use my finger that doesn't make any sense and there are a lot of inconsistencies like that in in the function the general functionality of this it just don't make like a whole lot of sense honestly it feels like a very uh napple like the fact that everything's not like smooth if I leave you a verdict on it right now I would say if it requires you saving up or if it's a major expense do not get it there are so many better things you could spend like 400 bucks on than this like I really believe a new cell phone has a really big impact on your life this doesn't so buy a better phone buy better computer put it towards a computer buy a camera those things will have like an actual quantifiable impact on your life this computerized watch won't that's it if you have like an extra 500 bucks that you were just going to spend on like strippers or cocaine or something like totally get it it's not a bad it's not a bad Buy so if you're going to spend it on jewelry or another watch like this is definitely a super radical watch I hope that was helpful all right I'm going to go home now because I'm sure the baby's awake and I get back to it she's awake just coming out of the bathroom I realize I left all my gear I may see unsupervised yeah still there take you to the hotel Martinez in Brooklyn where Bobby Melendez Orchestra are offering a program of dance music so I grew up not too far from here I grew up in like a dumpier town about 25 minutes away when I was a kid my parents would take us into New York City like maybe once a year or twice a year and I remember vividly sitting on the train looking out the window for that first glimpse of the skyline I was obsessed with New York City when I was a kid next morning time I'm in Connecticut I'm gonna go for a run I love running in New York City I love running here more I will show you why look at that beach streams and trees in nature let's see the fields of grass forest wild animals cannot come back does that make me a bad person fancy mansions that's thirteen point six miles at a 724 pace that run makes me so happy hey now right yeah you're headed back to C check that out what else these are some of my racing trophies this is when I won my division at an antique buy triathlon this is for third place in my age group at the Fort Lauderdale marathon second place first place third place first place first place first place first place third place first place second place first place second place third place first place second place first place these are some race pictures that's my little brother and me after my first Ironman that's Owen just dominating the field these are some of my break in my race medals that's from the Ironman US Championship that was a tough race alright y'all get outta here now I don't want to drive by part of the city X is too expensive to park all the Amtrak trains were sold out so hoenn is driving me to New Haven where you take the crappy commuter train into the city Thank You Phil that he's not happy about it getting some organic vegan lunch before I leave town all right bye my train leaves in one minute just made it just realized I decided to buy a ticket before you know this train just stopped in reverse directions why is this happening a full an hour late because that whole put in Reverse situation my hatred for Penn Station is inversely proportional my love for grandpa I have what I've described an irrational phobia for the subway but there's really no other way to get downtown right now so subway this is why I don't like sub took the wrong train got the wrong stop not the walk here for 15 years I've never figured out so trade was delayed subway was stopped left my keys in my office this dead oh good to be home I miss my ladies

the whole we cancelled the whole order I mean I think they're like nice stickers is what they look like the idea is right there just like I don't know they don't really look like anything so we cancel the order every time I try to record here these sirens go off and they mess up my sound and I can't finish my recording oh great it's my building that's my landlord so yeah being on Broadway is cool

beam wait on the vlog and that means this whole week I'm going to be talking about beam about the new company which is a mobile app a lot brace yourselves today though I'm going to talk about talking about I want to talk about talking about beam let me start right let me start by saying some really kind individuals have commented below and some equally kind individuals have commented on Twitter saying Casey's just blogging so we can talk about his app and they've said that's really lame well let me confirm yes I'm vlogging so I can talk about my app I started this vlog as a place to like share Who I am and my life and my experiences my stories with the universe and this company is my life this company is my everything and I'm really excited that it will be revealed for the first time on this vlog to you the people that I've tuned in every day to watch me like paddle board and hang around my baby you will now be the first to know about what I have been up to what my team has been up to what we've all worked so hard on for so long I think Marlins here you got something huge and heavy for me Marlin yeah really okay always a pleasure thank you this is not mail time this is something else because I'm pretty sure I know what this is and let me start by saying this is not a paid endorsement if this is what I think this is it is what I think it is this company in San Francisco emailed me saying that the hoverboard that I use this thing was not a real hoverboard that that they make a real hoverboard mystic and that they'd set anyone to check out holy good God look at this thing can't wait to ride this I will say that the dudes at one wheel the company that makes this when they send it to me they said make sure you read the instructions first but I like to I like to see how intuitive these things are so figured it out this feels much more dangerous than then the hoverboard oh god it's heavy okay it's a little bit like surfing this thing is way more robust than the little plastic hoverboard it's like riding a surfboard down Broadway this thing blows the doors off of those plastic Chinese hoverboards american-made videos on YouTube man hey I'm Casey - awesome Shay nice to meet you Oh I think I'm just gonna leave that there for now you know I like when you go skiing in your backyard on a sled hill or whatever and you're like I'm really good at skiing so then you go to the biggest scariest black diamond mountain and you get the top and you're like this was a terrible idea well that is the bunny slope and that is the Black Diamond today was an incredibly stressful day in the office everybody always asked how I'm always in such a permanent good mood I'm not it's just I only feel like hitting record on the camera when I'm in a good mood so

best Vantage is but I mean ahead to the southern tip of the island they come here they come I was incredible oh really they're coming back hazing so this is a quick lunch meeting with Sara and David

home friends we're going home now you're gonna go to bed good night my little girl you you can do it Carly all right you know you're doing there right supposed to be a hundred degrees out today but it's also Monday I'm psyched to be back in the office I've never been so buried or overwhelmed at work peak workday 2015 the spawn beam launched Friday all kinds of crazy crap accrued over the weekend that needs to be dealt with and now I'm heading in bright and early to confront it Thank You Miguel I've been trying to keep the old hoverboard out of the vlog but I just missed it so much it had to make a comeback morning you look tan now that the cat is out of the bag with beam I can share some of the things that have been doing a really terrible job of blurring here in the office okay first thing is this awesome motivational this is how to keep the team highly motivated and I've just been trying to blur the launch date and I was trying to blur it not because not because it's a secret but because like I didn't want to be held to it in fact we didn't end up launching when that was I shouldn't want to give people the wrong impression that's why we tried to blur that let's see what else these are some of our self-imposed deadlines like this was supposed to be when we had reactions up and running but this is the first deadline we missed we missed it by one day never okay on June 1st we had 100 beta users and then we had a follow graph on June 1st as well that sort of worked and then on June 10th we submitted to the App Store and then our initial approval in the App Store we only release the app in well it says Kazakh Stan but there's actually Kyrgyzstan that's kind of complicated like you have to release it in a region before you can lease an update we didn't end up doing any of that but we had a really funny plan where the app was only going to exist in Kyrgyzstan didn't happen and I wanted to announce the app on the vlog on July 13th that didn't happen instead I announce that July 17th but we weren't going to have it the app to download until the 20th and it was just going to be the app where you could get on the wait list and then we were going to launch it sneak preview on the 23rd and then at the official launch sometime thereafter and just to be clear the launch last week was only supposed to be a sneak preview that's why we had to like that's why we had this is Matt Matson that's why we had the bean codes is because we wanted to sort of curb people from using it until we were really ready it didn't work out that way everyone used it anyways but we're really excited about but that's why the bean codes are sort of being held back now is because this is only supposed to be a sneak preview but we're going to deal with that this week and there'll be a whole bunch of bean codes coming out so everybody will be able to get in and I am sorry that that people can't get in now that want to get in when do the new beam t-shirts show up they're on their way here hopefully now there's a tremendous amount of mail today for mail time so I'm going to grab a quick coffee and then happen I've been here for four hours KP one hour hour I'm so sorry so exciting

the block we'd win can we get rid of one hey sorry you missed it potatoes is like a vegetable or something cut your potatoes are vegetable cast that's basically salad and then Bacon's a meat yeah and then cheese is the protein - yeah yeah that's all pork burger 6:30 a.m. on a Saturday New London Connecticut going for a run with my friend Peter get it in yeah we're getting it in all right this is Peter's idea this is a beautiful view of Connecticut and this is a view of Peter taking a piss so they call it a wildlife sanctuary but it's actually where the nuclear power plant is all right these signs are a little bit more aggressive but you can still run back there it's just like the trail just continues you just have to go around this looks much more criminal than it actually is all right and then this here is where I feel like you have to turn around because beyond this is where there's like a security checkpoint I don't want to break any actual laws how many miles into here 7 1/2 so this will probably be a nice 15 mile run and we're back fourteen point four fourteen point four miles pretty good run a fourth of July all right good run man safe drive home for July 4th we're going to take the truck off-roading just got to get it ready better yes I'm sitting right here waiting for you my dear okay so we're going off-roading in these trails behind Target three concerns number one we don't have a spare tire these BF Goodrich all-terrain tires should be called some terrain because when you take them on all terrains they explode number two two times ago we were out riding these trails we were stopped by the police and got into some trouble free the very last time we were out there I actually crashed the Jeep into a swamp then we had to get towed out those are some of the variables we're dealing with may I please have the 1/3 pound triple with cheese and bacon just a sandwich and then the Baconator fries too describe it as healthy Oh on a scale of one to help you where would you put that fat I can't be good to the paintjob house just get on the tree you second in my face yes seems to be a sound coming from the motor are you laughing at thinking that tre well we got to get across this river somehow I'm more concerned with which river to traverse let's try this way this looks deep Oh God all right that's the way out of there should we leave or do one more which we should probably go right we've done a lot I was thinking we do one more oh really what the hell are we and now a restaurant review by owning KC today we will be reviewing Taco Bell's captain Captain Crunch delights made with Captain Crunch crunch berries hi hi could I please have a four pack of Cap'n Crunch delights nothing else okay and that'll do it we don't always eat at fast food just mostly eat at fast food it's our family time it's our family sorry I didn't mean to be so far away they you know her good that's it she said she liked our Jeep so I said thank you ladies love this car expectations of the captain crunch balls gonna be okay you think they're gonna be good Wow that color is not flattering this is what they look like uh really describe the look it looks like a dead tomato when I eat this I picture a baker hovering over the dough for doughnuts and in his right hand as a gigantic 1 gallon jar of just something that's called artificial red flavoring and he sneezes and dumps the entire jar of artificial flavoring into the doughnut bucket and then he's just like yeah get and then he goes on and makes the doughnuts anyways that's what these taste like do you think that's accurate mm-hmm and that is a food review from Casey and Owen Oh gross look it who's all over my pants starting to make me sick okay let's go Owen and I are gonna go watch TV do you mind watching the car before you come in going mutton is cool and all but you just get home and then have to wash the car it's not really that fun yes I'm sitting right here waiting for you my dear this is just it don't be dramatic come on this is this is just a test we have to pop these without like our hand entering frame so Jack's suggestion was the staple gun which is either genius or idiotic so I still run every morning I've just run run out of interesting ways to videotape my same run on the same route every day so that's why these runs have not been appearing in this vlog this guy right here that's Peter Dinklage from Game of Thrones eleiza and this girl right here is Lindsay my running partner let's go north cuz a fleet week we can see the boats let's go see the boats it's a tank on the west side highlight yeah have you ever seen an armored personnel carrier on the Westside Highway thank god no so exciting okay keep running oh yeah just taking a quick pause one of my favorite triathlons is the New York City triathlon but it's a race I will never do again because it requires you to swim in the Hudson River beautiful River and that's the water Lindy til next time safe run home but eleven point seven miles at a 750 pace and there at the Hangout Lindsey strong run today you're about to see some skateboard footage that was not shot on this thing this is the stabilizer I use the other day so expect shaky rocky normal-looking skateboard footage you might remember this place from the Mother's Day vlog you thank you for my balloon this is my favorite store in New York City by the way was that good okay I won't edit that out I promise I was in the last one you were in the last these are what I needed got the balloons now I need cigarettes kind of a pack of parliment cigarettes please buh-bye alright it's gonna make me throw up that's why I wanted your help I'll smoke a little bit but not a lot it's really bad for you so what I'm trying to do is I want to fill up balloons with smoke and I tried to find like a turkey baster to suck the smoke out and then pump it in there's nothing you would turkey baster so we have to smoke suck the smoke out of the cigarettes and blow up three balloons it's not a lot for their small balloons alright we've got our three darts ready we've got the camera set up behind us now it's time to smoke some cigarettes kids don't smoke also don't try this at home also just don't smoke in general don't smoke cigarettes don't ever smoke cigarettes well I will fill one up a little bit and then let it to the smoke out and see you kind of out okay okay let's see you let it out in front of camera so that's pretty smoky that's pretty smoky oh oh oh oh you definitely gonna throw up some went into my lungs can't see because I don't see any smoke it's pretty smoky to pop the balloons why not just use the propane torch it should work all right blow torch lit business let's talk okay love it slowly so it lingers all right I'm not sure that's going to work that did succeed in making both Jack and me sick but I guess here goes the new intro roll it so let's talk business my plan in starting this vlog was to spend a lot of time talking about my yet undisclosed new business I know I've been super cagey about it and they're also like real kind of mechanical considerations like legal stuff and the patent applications doesn't and filed so I still can't show you literally what we're making and I don't want this vlog to become like neat teasing about this thing that I'm making about this new company that is my whole life and not saying what it is so I want to like restructure this segment and I want to get into like a little bit of the history a little bit of the last 18 months almost that have been entirely devoted to building this business and explained some of that with you because that is something that I can freely talk about okay so I want to go all the way back to the very very beginning where I decided to start a new business and the first thing I had to learn was how to start a new business I'm riding my bike to Union Square now so I think this story will be more compelling if I tell it in the location where it took place either March or February of 2014 so this is like a year plus ago I've been sitting on this idea for a really long time and I hate sitting on ideas I think ideas you either act on or you set them free you don't dwell on an idea or it will go rotten really quickly and I had been dwelling on this idea for a really long time I asked someone that I really look up to and someone that I consider a mentor as person in particular someone I admire in every capacity he's an incredible father an amazing friend a wonderful human being and a brilliant brilliant businessman anyways I asked him for some of his time and we met for lunch we met in a restaurant this was the actual restaurant right here it's called coffee shop and this was the actual table we were sitting out here I told him about this idea this this thing that had been sitting with me for a while and he said is this a project or is this a company and I said this is a company and he said okay you're gonna need money I was like writing down like everything he said and he said write down the names of every person you can think of that you could ask for money and then put a number next to their name for how much you think you could ask them for and that's like that's a that's a crazy idea that's something I have never I'm not big on asking anyone for anything but I followed his advice and I did that I wrote down all the names I have my own dreams in life and I have my own lists of things that I hope to accomplish before I die but write that in there I showed him the names of people that I wanted to ask for money and he looked at and he said this is good and then he said wanted to put me on that list to wanted to put me down for a hundred thousand dollars and that just like shook my world it's like it shook me to the core and right in that moment that feeling that he gave me of someone believing in me someone I admire so much believing in me on that level at that moment my new dream in life my new goal in life is to one day do for someone else what he did for me in that moment because what he did was he said I believe in you I want you to do this thing I want you to realize your your this dream of yours and here I'm willing to back it up with an insane check and that was it that was how this company started and the weird thing about having someone step up for you for having someone believe in you like that is it really raises the stakes of failure it means to fail now means to let him down the flipside of that is it really it really pushes you to succeed all right I guess that's it now there are about a hundred of these stories between that day and where my company is now and I want to share them all in this vlog and I want to do it as best I can without being super annoying because I won't have shared with you what this company is but I really think this is like the best the only way that I can start to really share some of the details of what it is I'm up to because I've said it before and I really mean it this company is my full life you get drawn ready Oh ready set go instigator troublemaker its morning time in Los Angeles this is what we're working with out here kind of a gloomy situation dense fog low visibility swimming pool I'm here in LA for work I'm supposed to be here for two days that could get extended but for now I'm supposed to be on a plane out tomorrow what this is the problem with traveling with Jerome Jarre no matter where he goes he's hounded by teenage girls everybody knows that Kofi it's poverty have in my life never seen someone drink through in the back of the tip the cookie that you do is that you drink up in hip whitetip okay Jerome and I have a meeting in 46 minutes so I'm going to use this next 46 minutes for a special Los Angeles edition of Q&amp;A okay Q&amp;A time special Los Angeles edition I'm sitting somewhere at some restaurant where we bought food just so I could sit here and record a QA let's get started mr. Nick Brock you asked when are you gonna reveal the new company how about right now okay very happy to announce the name of the new company is beam henceforth I will no longer refer to the new company as the new company I'll only refer to it as beam ok a little explanation the reason why I haven't been able to tell you the name of the company is because we've been like fighting and fighting to get the URL the web address beam comm which we got but I couldn't say the name of the company until we had it because there's a lot of jerks out there that might try to buy the URL out from under us and like and that would cause a whole bunch of headaches for us so thank you for your patience I apologize for taking so long I hope it makes sense that I had to get the web address before I could say the name beam beans the name of the company I'm going to say beam as much as humanly possible so beam sticks because new company really stuck and I have to change that habit also we were trying to get the Twitter handle beam app which we got so now we have beam com we have beam app on Twitter we're good more very very soon about beam beam okay next question how do you start to be a filmmaker you just start there's no process you just start and it takes a long time to learn but really the only way to get there is just start it's like anything else you want to learn how to play basketball you pick up the ball you want to be a filmmaker you just pick up whatever camera you have probably your phone and just start overthinking the process will kill any career in the creative space you just have to do not think do you budget your money Elena I'm really embarrassed to say that I'm terrible absolutely terrible with money I'm not proud of that and I'm working hard to get more responsible especially with like Owen going to college next year I've been saving for a decade for his college fund and it's still not going to be anywhere near enough I want to be better with money mmm coconuts yeah I'll take one of those coconuts she asks how did you become so handy idea I grew up in a house with four kids two parents everything was always broken so if you wanted anything to work you first had to fix it and growing up in an environment like that you're forced to be handy I love hanging on to the craft of making things Kyle asks what are your motivations to get up in the morning I don't know I'm always in a crazy rush to get my day started laying in bed is stagnation it's like I'm not I'm not doing anything so there's always a real urgency for me to get up get out and start the day what's your best advice for young relationships Chadd asks when the app is launched what comes next I mean what comes next is actually building out the company launching the app launching beam is just crossing the starting line not the finish line it's like if I can equate it to running because I'm a big runner a big marathoner it's like building this thing has been training for the marathon and when we launch it's when the starter pistol goes off and you start but that still means you have the longest hardest most challenging run ahead of you that could last who knows how long okay I'm gonna stop right there because drums back thank you as always for your questions more Q&amp;A next week I'm just finishing up another overprice super healthy meal that looked like this I was launched from delicious and have house Elan fruity and completely free drinks one two three thank you sir I don't know how I can screw up my vlog two days in a row but I screwed up my vlog two days in a row so all of the rest of the footage for today's vlog so all of this the microphone was off four so see all these bumpy lines here that's audio then there's no audio none which really sucks so here let me just show you what happened drove and I got lost in an apartment building which was a little bit stressful then we got trapped in an elevator then we got trapped in another elevator then we called for help which didn't really work out and then we went to a friend's house and they went up for dinner and Marcus took us through it like salads or something but they took forever to cook although I didn't think it he cook salads and then we cross the street here open music to this and then we said goodbye I probably said like I'll see you later and then that was kind of it so I was explaining to Jerome earlier today how yesterday I accidentally deleted all my footage and normally that would have been like the death sentence for a movie but because I've obliged myself to posting every day I forced myself to finish that video by using like titles and whatever I had to do to get through it and this is like another example like it's 5:15 in the a.m. and all I want to do is like go to bed right now but I'm committed to posting every day therefore I have to figure out some way to salvage this vlog and post it I have to finish what I've started so now this vlog is like about like determination and commitment I will finish this vlog it just probably won't be very good and for that I apologize are you ready to go call an uber you're in the shower oh okay come on you two cars waiting come on Gigi come on let's go are you ready hey there's a car Saturday morning 7 a.m. we are headed to Connecticut right now it's a big weekend in Connecticut this weekend what's happening Candice so fast the July 4th of New London because New London doesn't celebrate July 4 he knows but I see yes Enrique have a good weekend going in are you doing back there Francine yeah we're leaving soon obligatory rest stop break ready what's this Oh ready there you go she's like no don't come in that car seat again they closed up all the streets here in downtown in London for this wholesale fest situation so we had to do some circumnavigation but fever you're pretty good job sandi it daddy how's the tick off this don't have any teeth I got a mother lonagain we are going to the beach now I'm going to test out the new GoPro what's this thing Bob the new tiny GoPro sessions it's called new GoPro sessions actually all this next footage will be shot on this yes is everything okay you ready to go to the beach you can't have that this is the new GoPro camera so far the only problem I found with it is that Francine wants to eat it ah look at okay that was our trip to the beach shot on the new GoPro let me know how it looks in the comments below I think it looks pretty good pretty good so I think is the first time we've ever been to this place and we're pretty discerning a lobster roll critics and I would say the lobster roll was like a nine coleslaw was out there maybe a nine so yeah we liked it I give it a recommend you get the baby I'll get the stuff hi Candace there's a big firework show happening downtown lots of faff ik oh and I are taking the Vespa to get there you ready okay this is my dad's here we made it to my old man's place he has like the best view of these fireworks so the fireworks blast off right there and we sit up here on this rooftop it's pretty great that's my dad there I'm also shooting the fireworks with my big camera but this isn't super dependable so I don't know if it's gonna work out fireworks started I think that's it I think they're over this is a very important disclaimer this video is not an advertisement for McDonald's this is not done with their involvement and definitely not done with their permission kind of a special presentation in today's vlog this is Oscar you might remember Oscar from previous films Oscar and I like two years ago two years ago we're in Hong Kong Singapore Hong Kong we're in Hong Kong shooting some video for something while in Hong Kong we did a restaurant review of a Hong Kong McDonald's where we eat all their weird food and stuff creamy this is today's vlog is part two of that video we're going to go review another McDonald's very special McDonald's five more minutes create your own burger okay look good she's not a dollar menu all right this is it Oscar delicious new day at McDonald's a bold new experience all right create your own come on Oscar is custom building his McDonald's burger on this computer machine you can do all four cheeses times three okay so that's 12 times the amount of cheese yeah huh okay this is it this is Oscar's burger he's got two quarter-pound patties three times bacon a roll three times parmesan three times pepper jack three times grilled tomato three times quoi three times onions oh my job do you want one too hot one I'm gonna go with something slightly more conservative we're having a lot of fun are you in here before oh my grades I check how was it let's have how was the burger yes sir thanks for the input you can't know yeah yeah no no this way okay I'm sorry sorry for the trouble okay this is kind of a throwback to our situation in Hong Kong where you're not allowed to film in here hold help no photos okay sorry yeah we're not filming we're shooting video my one criticism of the place is that this music is overbearing here comes our burgers whoa that's it yes you is that one burger yeah thank you oh my thank you looks beautiful you may look what is the prize uh I'm okay yeah thank you though appreciate it thank you Oscar's burger is so big that they had to put it in two baskets and it takes up an entire tray this is just the accoutrement that's the burger this is what's on it there's so much cheese on this thing I just need the picture this is gonna be the thumbnail I lost you it looks amazing you wanna bite yeah how about it'll loosen up the jaw isn't it I just ate cheese you got the cheese bye you are legitimately going to finish that I cook the Baker now and we didn't really eat the fries but I killed my burger and then Oscar killed his and his at least three times the burger of my burger xxx bacon don't do it don't even try but 12 times the cheese here's the conclusive review okay let's bring in an Oscar okay on a scale of one to ten one being a regular like rest stop highway side of the road McDonald's in ten being like the best restaurant you've ever been atmosphere is like a five music's too loud that's such an easy thing it brings it down cleanliness on a scale of regular McDonald's to the best ever seems like a six it's like a well above average in here for New York City McDonald's I'd give it a a the fries were like a chew I think there were like the same as regular McDonald's I just give them a slight bump up because of that handsome basket they came in yeah they weren't that great this service I do not I give it a ten absolutely a ten like like they were nice they were attented they were fast no assumptions about what we were doing whatsoever it isn't just what these guys want we're gonna give it to them here are your twenty hot sauces but the main thing the burgers um I give it like a seven eight I was shocked at how good it was agree I'm firm eight and a half I asked them to mix a number of ingredients that don't go together and it still tasted very good it was good okay and for presentation my god when can you order a burger and it comes out and it looks like that let's get the hell uh in conclusion new fancy mcdonald's thumbs up thumbs up and that's worth tasting what that's it the hell out here yeah let's go to lunch hi I'm Devin I'm from Oakland California I love traveling exploring doing weird things I wish I had more time to explain it to you so follow me on beam username debo de vo okay just got back with Devin after a long skateboard ride and there's

the studio first time in person I'm excited about this I see another vlog they're calling us Universal that marriage is for that reason okay the reason why this mirror is here is because there's a camera here aha and a camera here okay so if you put a mirror here people will always stare at themselves and not notice the cameras it's a fad inside our scope yeah Wow and that camera is there just so we can see right here to see what's out there who's banging at the door team Supertramp so if I had to describe the work that Devon here does by the way you've definitely seen his work if you think for a second it's up with Mike but it's like super high production action-packed videos is that fair that is exactly a fair now we love it okay and we wanted to do like a collabo today I don't know what that collaboration should look like but we're starting by my default which is to get on two high-powered electric skateboards and just see what happens all right I got the Chargers all right

England obviously I said that already I think you should follow me being because of try make everything as interesting as possible and I always talk to my viewers I really reach out and talk to my views personally so if you're into that kind of thing check me out be my name is Terrell ta ry double-l check me on being thank you very much okay I'm in the wrong store thank you yeah that is the woman's store I need to go to the men's store morning I'm like six miles into my run or some somewhere uptown one of the things about running in this in this city is that if you have to go to the bathroom it's almost impossible so I'm on this like permanent search for places to take a leak and this morning I might have found my favorite place to covertly pee in New York City you just stand right there and then you pee and no one notices you Oh Kevin half miles at a 7:36 pace really into this summertime in New York City business all right I'm gonna go to work have a good day have a good day today's Friday Friday is the most frustrating day of the week for me it means the week's over just like every other week I probably didn't get done as much as I'd hope to get done you coming to lunch don't walk okay can I have the roast chicken sandwich new lunch spot today burger I see you went to the dark side Jack and got cheeseburgers instead of our healthy quinoa Yeah right absolutely reeks of piss outside right now there's some kid hovering by my bicycle something tells me you don't want to talk to me anyway I've got a race uptown now for a fitting I'm very late and I set this camera up so skid I'll just come talk to me and it'll be on camera hey good how's it going good then good luck my bike hold on I was invited to another one of these fancy parties and I don't have any clothes for it so they're sending me to a designer right now who's going to like put me in some handsome clothes for a party that I'm going to on Monday night I could probably just wear my own clothes to these things but they offer to have somebody dress you like someone who's really good at picking out clothes for you how do you say no to that I don't know the legalities of riding a bike through the Grand Central Station passage but I know it's a lot of fun I've never done it with a camera before yes this should be interesting I'm currently on 53rd Street and I'm supposed to be on 72nd Street making progress whoa this part of the city uptown this place is like a foreign land for me I come here exactly never this is now where I'm headed see how this goes hey done okay cuz your security your security looks like they're gonna they're about two seconds away from cutting my throat what is expected of me at this thing I mean I don't think it's too fancy I think it's pretty casual for the most part um I want to look like I'm from the future I'm going to see size-wise with Miss Bobbye okay so yeah we would treat it but I think in general it's a pretty good fit and then we oh we can also just go throughout a very classic tux well that's a pink without I think I don't know I love the peak for you I don't know if I love the peak either I don't even know her peak is so far this is going pretty well I haven't decided on what to wear yet but I'm digging the options this is the fanciest dressing room I've ever been in I think this is probably better than the white right yeah it's just really elastic and yes chic and sharp plus it matches my sunglasses okay should I take off these clothes now yeah we're good okay I'm gonna close this door goodbye ladies thank you for everything um are you gonna be there no I will not be there but I mean in pictures is there in spirit like that goes yes exactly okay when they ask me who I'm wearing I just mentioned both of you by name right okay bye guys alright guys have you have fun with your Apple watch Matt I will later Jacob position it's pretty late it's a quarter after 8:00 right now I really wanted to get home earlier today but today was just a crazy day you know ninety percent of my time now during the day sitting at my desk working that'll make more sense when I do another like let's talk business update which I plan on doing very soon because I am tremendously excited to share on this vlog what I'm doing in my new company and I know that's long overdue but it will happen soon and I hope it'll all make sense then until then I'm going home and I hope the baby's away oh don't tell mommy I kissed a you hear that guy yeah it's okay guys screaming I don't even see anybody huh it's so nice out here it's wonderful Monday is by far my favorite day of the week it's akin to standing at the starting line to a race where the entire journey the entire week is ahead of you you have everything to look forward to it's all systems go on Monday also I hate Fridays I'm running out of ideas about how to make watching me run be interesting thirteen point two miles at a 740 toothpaste hey half marathon nobody smiles on you when you run in New York City I try to smile at everyone no one ever smiles back it's my own way it's not only good look at the doctors today good look at the doctor there used to be a bodega across the street from the office that had delicious bacon egg and cheese sandwiches after 20 years they closed down now nothing I mean we have dollar pizza you could do that for breakfast but I've gone down that road before and it does not end well for anymore I got it I got it I hope this is it I hope this is it definitely not it thank you ah okay this this is a rare sighting but it's also one of my favorite things with my favorite things to see in Chinatown this is the flying dress ready do the flying dress a lot wait for it they're gonna come up here look at that so the question is how do you get an entire truckload full of dresses from the 6th floor of a sixth floor walk up to a truck the answer is where do they make the dresses up there and then you deliver them and this is how you get them from there to here for now besides me you get people all day long asking you questions everybody loves it right we've been nicknamed if the Chinese are zipline down Chinatown zipline look at that my crazy German waterpark movie just crossed 15 million use I don't know who's watching this movie 15 million 3000 views that's crazy I haven't worked dinner tonight so I'll run home see Candace and the baby because they will be asleep when I come tonight okay bye guys and back to work a Tupac now we're leaving for dinner this is are you coming this is this very late night for we usually unmold there's some sort of athletic shoe happening here young lady enter sports bra running through the streets we don't know what your problems are generally I'm not super big on going out I like to work I'd exercise I take home socialized and doesn't really fit into my schedule so tonight is extraordinary I'm at have a good night have a good night man good night sir good night good night this is fun now obviously okay it's super late now headed home long day [Music] all right now I want to tell a story this is a story that I've been meaning to tell that I've wanted to tell for a really long time in life there's there's risk and there's recklessness and risk is always okay risk is always meant to be pursued but recklessness is really dangerous and really stupid and should always be avoided but the two are really close and like from afar they're very hard to tell apart this story is of the time that I cross the line from risk in direct lessness and this is probably the only time in my life where I've ever felt like I lost control and when I say I lost control you know I'm somebody who's like I've jumped out of an airplane in Israel I've jumped into a sinkhole in the Middle East I flew in an attack helicopter over Afghanistan I got hit by a car and shattered my leg in 27 places and I've crashed more motorcycles and honestly I can keep track of but this is the only time we're looking back at it really examining it I realize how stupid it was honestly I think that I made it out of there that I survived by like by a thread one of my closest friends in the whole world is a guy by the name of Graham Graham VC is freaking the out in 2007 graham and another friend and my brother in me we all climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania it was super awesome like Mount Kilimanjaro is it was fun it was exciting I climb it in sneakers and though it's like a little bit dangerous it's not a particularly hard climb it was great that we had fun than Kilimanjaro but after that Graham and I got to talking and we thought it wasn't enough of an accomplishment or of a challenge for guys like us that is like reckless individuals with very little forethought we wanted something more ambitious so Graham and I made the somewhat rash decision to climb a mountain called Aconcagua aconcagua was the tallest mountain in the southern hemisphere it's the tallest mountain in the world outside of the Himalayas with just about zero preparation and no training Graham and I packed up a bunch of gear we flew to T Leigh and we headed to the mountain just got to Santiago Chile now aconcagua is twenty two thousand eight hundred and forty-one feet tall that's high it's not a really technical mountain you don't need ice axes or crampons or like ropes or anything you just go up that said it's an incredibly dangerous Mountain I'm sitting at a computer right here and I typed in definite incog wa January 2009 that is days after we were there five climbers died I mean that was literally days after we had left the mountain I can't describe how excited we were we had nothing but like an unbridled enthusiasm when approaching the mountain there was this moment when I saw the actual mountain for the first time we've been hiking for like three days and it was the first time where we could see like an unobstructed view of what we were about to ascend and that was the first time I was a little bit scared our goal wasn't just to climb the mountain we wanted to summit the mountain do it with no porters that is no one to help us carry our hundred plus pounds of gear up the mountain and no guide no one to show us the way for fun we also brought no GPS just a map and a pencil we're at sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty feet check out the view outside of our tent you can see the curvature of the earth from here it's pretty amazing you also can't see how bad it smells in this test because they had Jamaican barbecue chicken for dinner yeah and we had pad thai two days ago and leftovers were left in the tented baked for the last two days here's where the stupidity kicks in Graham and I were both like really narrow focused individuals and when we set our minds to something we stopped at nothing to achieve it put two people like that together and put them at the foot of an incredibly dangerous mountain and that's a horrible combination my brain's gonna explode my head hurts my eyeballs are swollen my neck hurts I don't want to do anything I just want I just want the pain to stop and I have another 8,000 feet to go we had this mantra that we kept repeating that was summit or bust as in at all cost we were making it up this mountain there was no showering and it took us like a week to get to base camp alone so this next round of footage this is when we started to climb from base camp to the summit we don't really look great we're lost not about 21,000 feet it's a funny place to be lost and above 20,000 feet there are no helicopters there's no rescue squad you are on your own it's 4:15 in the morning on Christmas morning about 21,000 feet it's about 15 below out and we have to wake up now and Joe summit the Beast everything is caked in this ice and it drips down on you Merry Christmas on Christmas Day 2008 it was summit day we're 37 minutes into our summit push and we're watching the Sun Rise over the Andes and we are literally over the Andes now you have this thing called turnaround time and that means no matter what at this time of the day you turn around I think ours was like 2:00 p.m. and ideally we would summit prior to that time and start climbing down but if had we not summited no matter what you turn around at your turnaround time right there we're so close to summit but I keep like blacking out I think it's from the altitude we're both hurting pretty bad I've never been anywhere near this altitude but the part that hurts the most the summit is right there we're gonna do it we're gonna go for it we're gonna go for it around the world not to two hours past turnaround time we hadn't made it we're so close to summit so close just wish it would stop snowing so far away sumit is right there now the title of this video the title of this vlog episode is the day I almost died and that's not hyperbole that is literally what happened in these moments I have no memory of what happened then I only have this footage and what I what I remember explicitly was being so tired that I wanted to go to sleep I wanted to lay down on that mountain and go to sleep had I done that who knows what would have happened but I don't know that I would have woken up if I had taken a nap at 22,500 feet with no energy no water no food no oxygen and no one to help me down this is the hardest thing I've ever done I can't breathe but I would never be able to live with myself if I didn't go for it so I have to take every ounce of energy I have in my body I've got to get to that summit it was that moment that I felt like I had crossed that line in a really profound way it was that moment that I felt like closer to not making it than any other time in my life that wasn't me summit of the tallest mountain in the southern and western hemisphere across we summited we shouldn't have we should have turned around but we summited and for the first time ever right now I honestly don't know what the I was thinking and we both sort of made it down in okay shape Graham took one really bad fall that I thought I thought he was seriously injured but he was he was fine Graham just fell off a cliff and was laying facedown no idea what happened to him I think he tried to slide down it and just ended up going tits up and we were beaten to hell I don't know what my middle name is I couldn't tell you my social security number I think there might be an eight and it barely speak I did summon it but at what cost my god when we like naively stupidly left to climb that mountain a lot of people were like there's no trance in fact it's the only time that I remember in my whole life where my brother doubted me he didn't think I would make it and I would say like that's what drove me to tax Lee summit I put that as like me being reckless in order to prove something that ultimately doesn't matter when you compare it to your health or your safety or your life there is one super cool detail which is aconcagua was in the southern hemisphere and the only taller mountains in the world in the himalayas that is their winter so no one's climbing in the Himalayas then so at 4:06 p.m. on Christmas Day 2008 Graham and I were literally standing taller than any other human beings on planet Earth because we were at the top of the tallest climbin at that very moment at that very day and that's a pretty amazing legacy to have [Music] and that is what Graham VC taking your looks like [Music] I up to funny spectacle the team the wedding and then the funeral and the travel and all that I haven't gotten a good run in in like a week or a week and a half which is like the longest I've gone in a really long time without running so I'm psyched to make this morning town I'm at my halfway point out there is this mighty wind that's blowing directly at my face here such a crazy headwind running up here that on the way back I'm counting on it being an equally crazy tailwind so I barely have to run on the way back I just kind of fly that's the theory anyway all right that was 11.7 four miles at a 741 pace that oh that headwind was tough that wind just blew this phone off that off of that ledge there okay time to get to work are you going to hang out with your friends now are you in here yeah have a nice walk have a nice walk today's Friday end of the week mixed emotions about that last night I loaned my friend Sam my booster door my boosted board wonder how he did with it yeah did you hurt yourself I didn't hurt myself yeah I fell only in the hallway you were riding that in the hallway because you know what it's our raining and I like couldn't resist riding it more today is in turn Peter's last day Peter what are your final thoughts how was your summer at bheem that's possible summer this is the yeah this is way better than

to the studio my favorite visitor coming home that you I'm not interested if any of you yeah I'm only interested in these two [Music] there's no blog today there there's no blog today I'm sorry instead there will be a special presentation moreover this special presentation is not for is not for you my blogging audience this is a personal special presentation and it's for my in-laws I'd appreciate a little bit of privacy because this is kind of a personal video and if you're not either Candace's mother or Candace's father please stop watching right now so June Stanley Candice and I made this for you or we we tried to make this for you like a year and a half ago we wanted to make something that's a way of us saying thank you for what was the greatest wedding South Africa has ever seen it really was like a great wedding saying goodbye was tough last morning in Cape Town goodbye mountains goodbye twelve apostles by lions head by Table Mountain is that it are getting in the car honey say goodbye to the house [Music] okay we're leaving Cape Town we're going on a honeymoon and I remember Candice cried in the airport when she said goodbye to you June and then we left and I think we're in Singapore the next morning when Candice hatched this idea to bring you guys along with us on our honeymoon via a video and that's what this is yeah now I'm sure you remember I didn't want to go on this boat it was Candace's cheerleading that made it happen but how she convinced me to go on this this this boat ride thing was that she kept promising the most amazing beautiful weather I'd ever seen when we finally did get on the boat that afternoon we were so tired we passed out and we woke up at like 1:00 in the morning and there was like no food so Candice broke into the ship's kitchen and stole a bunch of cereal it's for the morning or spilling cereal first stop on the boat was somewhere in Malaysia and Candice was really excited about going mountain biking the thing about being stuck on a tiny boat with a bunch of strangers is there's really only one good way to pass the time now the only problem with Candice staying up all night drinking every drop of hooch on that boat now besides the fact that if anyone tried to do karaoke when she was around she would violently and aggressively commandeer the microphone from them every day every morning she would be so hungover their end up having to like play by myself I'm never drinking again one of our favourite stops was in Thailand I think is in Phuket because I got to have a pedicure where those fish eat your feet and Candice got to go buy a bunch of jewelry our cab driver tickets Thailand's largest jewelry store and and I saw an old white guy like 90 years old buying an engagement ring for a 30 year old Thai girl it was also in Thailand where we saw this couple and Candice said that's going to be us in 30 years [Music] feel good Kandice would order room service and she would just say bring one of everything on the menu we would eat like one french fry and then pass out so every morning we would wake up and the entire room would just be covered in food [Music] later [Music] last night of our honeymoon goodbye relieving the honeymoons over [Music] that's it guys [Music] I'm not going to film my run this morning because I have a little less than an hour and I really want to get a solid run in so the next shot is just going to be this exact same shot at me but after I've run for like 55 minutes ready okay that was seven and a half miles at a 720 pace warm outside today look at this sweat by the way this Tom Brady shirt Tom Brady gave to me personally so it's kind of special to me my days are so much better when I run in the morning Matt is back today he's been out for three days for his birthday and today he's back looking forward to seeing the guy you want to try it how's the occasion there's fantastic questions and answers Casey what happened to your Apple watch ah I broke the metal part that connects the band to the watch itself not apples fault I like totally mess with it and customize it and I fell off my skateboard broke it I ordered a new generic part and it just hasn't shown up yet still a big fan of the Apple watch would you risk your own life to save someone in need like stopping an armed robber or run into a fire to save a random child I mean of course I'm going to say yes but you don't know the answer to that question until you're in that situation kind of a crazy question Gonzalez what do you think about the comfort zone I think it's the worst place you could ever be when you're hungry you want more when you're wildly successful you can embrace your hard work and be proud of it when you're in the comfort zone it's just wow do you feel pressured to always record everything from your life no and the truth is like I don't record that much I do shoots for the vlog like a pretty small amount of the day like I need something to be happening in order to record it and then I put that into a story I call it a vogue I post it on YouTube it's never recording the whole day Alex asks other than hard work what advice would you give to better yourself both in life and in your career field focus focus is super underrated like if you commit all that you are and all of your energy to one thing you'll okay that's like this diagram this is I took this from a book called I don't know what it's called it goes like this alright you can do ten things to like the first degree like this right here and that's how well you'll do all ten things or you can do one thing to the tenth degree right there and look how much better you do that so when it comes to focus to put all of your energy into one thing is to do that one thing really well to the best of your abilities to take it all the way and to scatter yourself means you're never actually polishing anything you're just sort of chipping away at a bunch of nothingness and this is true for work this is true for like dating versus committing yourself to one person friendship everything like really focusing and investing yourself into something you're passionate about will always yield better results then scattering yourself around then spreading yourself thin if you could do it all again would you change anything fun question I'm not really into hypotheticals I'm very rooted in reality and where I am right now and to look back and say I would have done this differently would mean that I might not be in the position I'm in right now and I'm really happy with the progress I've made in life so I'm much more about looking forward and thinking what can I do now to affect my future that I am looking at my passing I wish I had done this can you sing I wish I could sing I wish I could sing I wish I could dance I can do neither Josh asks how much of yourself you see in Owen as far as personalities and mannerisms and what not a lot but I mean I try to emulate Owen I think more so than he tries to emulate me Owen is definitely a better person than I am he's more considerate and thoughtful and concerned with other people's needs I would say there are much more selfish than Owen and that's the quality in him I admire the most so I try more to be like my kid then I would say my kid tries to be like me and as a parent that's like I feel pretty great about that does it get annoying having kids wait outside your office annoying I've never invited anyone to stand outside my office and the reason why I go visit them outside is because I feel guilty I'm always flattered and always really excited about the fact that people respond to the movies I make so much that they want to meet me so I would never like say no or be mean or discourage but this is a place of business like we have eleven people working next door on beam there's a lot going on here and I'm working really hard to make this work so the distraction is unwelcomed and I try to do meetups at our last meet of we bought 500 pizzas like we try to do cool things like that all in I would say don't come visit me here I really like it's a big distraction I will say though that when kids come into this building and come outside my office door that is not cool at all we're trying to work in here we're having meetings in here conference calls like this is a very productive very busy company here and having kids knock on the door X I think it's funny or cute or clever or that they're special is completely unwelcomed and not cool and pisses me off because it lacks any respect for Who I am as a professional I would never show up at your office I would never knock on the door of your classroom and come in there and say hi and ask for a selfie because that's your space I hope that doesn't sound too harsh like I said I really value and have such appreciation for people that respond to my work so profoundly I love meeting new people but boundaries and respect is something I hold dear and I expect that from others ok that's it for today's Q&amp;A one of my favorite things always is meeting new youtubers today Benji is here and we're doing a little interview for Benji's new YouTube channel what's it called vengeance of video influencers but we also have a daily vlog my wife and I it's Judy's life so okay I'll link both those channels below thank you but for Benji's in what's ago video influencers vlog we're doing like a an interview right now and just got us set up this is Benji's microphone yes so Emma I like I'm almost embarrassed about this but I try to go simple you know try not to go too overboard my production anyways you can see the interview on his channel little link below are listed right there let's do it okay yeah this was awesome so good to meet you yeah take care and just go down you got it good luck with the kids outside yeah take care of Benji great guy really good youtuber him and his wife have like a family channel that's super positive and I don't meet him yeah look we're playing your show all the time I saw you put that on your team I appreciate it for the crowd man that's it man you're amazing understand all the kids are like looking at you like awesome Alan I really don't feel good I look sick feel terrible the baby was sick last week maybe that's what it is heat not feeling perfect all the time this is awesome so cool you think I was Sean Penn I am not Sean Penn but that car is awesome for years when I worked in advertising the first thing that clients or agencies would always ask me is can you make us a viral video and my answer was always no I had no idea how to make a viral video I can make you a really good video and maybe it'll go viral but I don't know how to make a viral video and that's the truth that's it every once in a while the moon's aligned with Pluto and there is a circumstance where in there is a ripe opportunity for making a movie with a very high probability of virality I think today might be one of those days by Francine Popeye Byzantine Popeye by Gigi have a good day with your treats by Candace I'm psyched to dedicate today's entire blog this idea of how to make a viral movie but I'm a little bit concerned because if I don't actually make this viral movie or if I do make it and it doesn't go viral then I'm not going to have much of a blog for today okay so here's the plan I I want to take an Apple watch like the cheap one and then spray-paint it gold and make a perfect gold Apple watch for like the price of the cheapest one but there are a ton of variables here mainly and then I don't have a watch I tried to get one the morning they came out but is like delivery might be in May so I was like that I'll just get one in the store when they're launched and then they announced that they're not selling them in the store but I've secured one it's my friends he should be bringing it by soon there's like a lot of moving parts to make a viral film and get it out there in time for it to actually pop I feel pretty teed up for it today it's like all of the pins are lined up I just got a roll a strike so what I'm going to try and do now is like all the shots I can that I need to build out this story without the watch that way when it does get here I can just like nail out those last shots with it and then get the movie posted timeliness is everything today we're going to go to the Apple store now tor try to get like some setup shots for the video I hope they'll let us film in there I think they will Apple is usually pretty cool about this stuff how's that for timing and as we pull up to the Apple store to look at watches I break my Rolex okay we failed we failed to get the shot from inside the Apple store every one of the Apple employees in there recognized me and then they were all like you cannot film in here what you're gonna do all right second Apple store hopefully we'll have better luck here to be discreet we pretty much got we needed I feel a little bit sneaky about it because we pretended we were taking still pictures but they were super cool the employees that are so nice like they don't want to say no I just think it's their job to say no okay just got the email from Sam I got the watch be there in 30 to 45 minutes looking good yes yo you got the watch let's do this Sam here delivered the Apple watch it's very strange-looking box I'm now going to begin the production in earnest my setup is here ready to go and Sam would you like to comment on your generosity and letting me vandalize your brand-new unopened out a lot um seeing as you've done this before I trust you but I haven't even seen the wash yet Casey is going to open the box right now and then just do what he wants with it but I think Sam's first mistake I trust you all right progress for four we have to watch taking apart but all the parts here this is the expensive part and it's currently being taped off Sam is still over there just being cool just watching you destroy my watch improve his watch okay got to apply the first coat of paint good so awesome look at that gold gold Sam gold no no going back now the paint job isn't completely done but I'm gonna stop right there and start editing while that coat of paint dries then when it's ready for the second coat of paint I'll throw that on there and hopefully have made some progress with the edit the movies being edited this thing is like great I'm just gonna do a second coat to make it Wallace I really want to get this thing posted as soon as possible it's drying in the window how does it look Jack it looks really really looks I know gold it a gold the Edit is coming along nicely that's a golden garbage can it looks incredible here's what we're working with that's the shot right now this is the watch head look at that gold and now all that's left is we're going to put the band's back on get whatever the final shot is and I finish this at it and get this thing posted sweet we finished it this is what it looks like look at that gold so good so psyched for this just got to finish the movie now it's it's getting really close okay the video is done I feel really good about it say who hasn't seen it yet it's happening it's happening okay mission accomplished for today's vlog d is the microphone plugged in the Apple watch is gold look at that thing in the gold Apple watch movie is live look at B I think the movie turned out really well too I don't know if it will actually go viral or not but I'm happy that I started this morning without this movie and I'm ending this movie I'm ending this day with this movie anytime you can start and finish a movie today to get feeling okay this generous guy here who let me who mate who realize my dream of spray painted Apple watch the day they came out Sam is from the verge the verge is my favorite slash deep slash the unquestionably best technology blog on the internet go check it out go check out the verge I had to say that because Sam was supposed to be at work today and instead he spent the whole day here helping me so okay leaving the office now what time is it it's 7:30 to my Apple watch it's 7:28 it's 7:30 I'm in big trouble with Canada so so so um at 6:30 but I had to finish Sam's gold Apple white looks fantastic movie I'm so excited that that thing got posted today check out this guy's scooter I like your scooter so awesome [Music] somebody said something mean to me yesterday and Twitter here's the thing about being me it's a lot easier to be mean than it is to be nuts so mean people on top of being jerks they're also lazy and they're uninventive being nice takes work that's why I really like people that are really nice [Music] we've been up since 440 this morning but one of us is in a great mood today was the second day that the baby woke up at 4:00 a.m. and I just decided to stay up a really great way to get a jump on the day it's 9:00 a.m. now I've been waiting for five hours and I usually start to crumble that like noon which is a problem I don't do this enough I should do this more often but I'm gonna take super quick nap it's 1:35 right now I don't have a meeting until 2:15 so they're out a little bit time to do the nap I'm gonna take a nap all right I'm not gonna get up and turn the camera off just let it roll out oh it's Tuesday it's cuter day day roll the intro while I take it out [Music] nap is over time to do the QA and kids let this be a lesson the only way you can have a job where you can sleep at work whenever you want is if you own the company entrepreneurialship has its benefits Evan wants to know why don't I put ads on my videos I don't know I guess I could I guess I just I will I will monetize my youtube channel I haven't yet because I hate watching ads most of the advertising on YouTube sucks so I would hate to subject people that are generous enough for their time to watch my movies with having to watch terrible adverts in front of my content that I worked so hard on does Candice get in order if you're vlogging yes she does what do you eat for breakfast you know I don't recommend this but I don't eat breakfast I've never had eaten bread who is your role model probably Malcolm X he's I mean there's a bunch of historical figures that I really look up to but Malcolm X is probably at the top of that list Cameron wants to know how would you spend the money if you won the lottery okay don't take this the wrong way but I hope I never win the lottery I never want money that I didn't earn were you scared when you quit your job to become a full-time filmmaker okay that's it this will be the only question I answer for the rest of this Q&amp;A I want to talk about risk as a guiding principle life shrinks and life expands in direct proportion to your willingness to assume risk yeah I like I've made some really stupid decisions in my career for my entire career on a broad plane they've all worked out every time I've quit my jobs which I've done every time had a job people that I trust most to treat people that I loved all advised against it my dad told me not to move to New York City because it was such a risk and every time I every time I took these bigger risks the opportunity for a larger payout was always there life is like this super temporary mega fragile thing you only get like a nugget of time to really pursue the things you care about and like I'm thirty thirty and my rule is that the right time is always right now to put a little meat on these bones this new company that I don't really talk about this new company is the biggest risk I've ever taken I took five years of my life to build my advertising career and I made like a lot of money I've been doing really great look at my youtube channel go all the way back the last branded content thing you'll see was in February of 2014 I ditched it all to pursue something I knew nothing about this huge risk and I did it at a time when my wife was pregnant and there was all of this vulnerability and all the scariness in my life and even now at 33 my dad's at 34 my dad said Casey that's crazy you've got a good thing don't let it go but I know that like someday I won't be able to do this I know that the time is now the time the right time is always now so I had to do it that's how I feel about risk in general and that's what the struggle has always been for me is like identifying risk identifying fear and then just smashing through it because a fear is looking back and wishing that I had done these things the most dangerous thing you can do in your career the most dangerous thing you can do in life is play it safe almost there just a couple blocks up ahead riding a bike in Midtown is suicide it's hard to pinpoint what's so gross about Midtown what is a mailroom spell mal he knows that I'm talking about so Candice and I had some legal issues with our previous apartment it's part of the reason why we moved out this is me dealing with that now okay awful medians that I'm trying to get out of here now get a little bit more of this sunlight where it goes away I have to run home for a minute and then back to the office

out alright so correct me if any of what I'm saying is nonsense this is the diamond district of New York City this is like where a lot of the diamonds come in and out of the USA right it's also really really gnarly and an interesting side note about this place is there are people walking around with pockets full of life hundreds of thousands of dollars of the gold and diamond a lot of them are armed to protect themselves right so you don't like you don't mess with anybody on these blocks you keep your head down and do your thing this is Candace's world this is how she does her jewelry where

this is my friend Nicky Nick and I used to sort of work together we shared a space for like when anyways he needed an SD card hope that works out for you man yeah it's a really long boring story but the end of it is KC's a girl again alright did I get you back to it buddy good luck with your photo shoot Thanks Kameron asks do you plan on running a marathon again in the future yeah I usually run a couple of year this year I'm signed up for New York City maybe I'll do one before but I don't know Jacob asks what is consistently the hardest part of your day leaving work every day it's a battle because I want to make it home to see the baby before she goes to sleep I want to see Candice but when it's like 6 7 8 o'clock time to go home I have like no where near completed my work for the day literally it's a struggle of mine every single day yeah here what was your major breakthrough in the business of film my major breakthrough well first of all first of all don't kid yourself it takes years and years and years there's no such thing at least in my experience of an overnight success it's just like gradual steps that get you closer to where you want to be with that my first movie that got a lot of exposure was a movie called iPods dirty secret I'll link it is a movie I made with my brother van in 2003 and it was like one of the first viral films it was a movie that was seen 5 million times on on the Internet three years before YouTube was even out that got me a lot of attention that was the first step in a very long process I can't underscore enough that it's never any one thing that takes you where you want to be what's the best way to find time to make films while in high school I don't know my army sympathy for you I've got a full-time job two kids baby wife house bills life reality and if I can find time to make some videos everyday then you can too I know what high school was like I did it for like a very short amount of time if it's something you really want to do you will find the time what's it like to be your own boss you know the last time I actually I had a boss I was 21 years old so I've worked for myself almost my entire adult life I don't know that I could function in any other environment I don't do well when I have someone questioning my judgment and I don't do well when I have to trust the judgment of someone else simply because they're my superior I just I don't do on that environment yeah I just watched rewatch this amazing Steve Jobs quote from like 1996 when you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your your life is just to live your life inside the world try not to bash into the walls too much try to have a nice family life have fun save a little money but life that's a very limited life life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact and that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it you can influence it you can you can build your own things that other people can use and the minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will you know if you push in something will pop out the other side that you can you can change you can mold it that's maybe the most important thing is to shake off this this erroneous notion that life is is there and you're just going to live in it versus embrace it change it improve it make your mark upon it I I think that's very important and however you learn that once you learn it you'll want to change life and make it better because it's kind of messed up in a lot of ways once you learn that you'll never be the same again okay I'll link that below but he really said it well and when it comes to where I want to exude my efforts and energy in life it's on something that I want to make sure is true to my own mission and my own goals so working for myself is something I take very seriously and everybody I work with are people who in some capacity share a similar vision so really it's this whole like be your own boss it's like if you if you're in the right place there is no boss it comes a collaborative effort by a group of individuals that share a mutual ambition and that's how I like to think of everything that I've done since I quit my last job whatever it was 14 years ago I'm going to end the Q&amp;A there Candice is doing like a sample sale today at her jewelry company so I'm gonna go visit her hey Casey is your car thank you so much thank you Nick how did it work out super well we got everything we needed who's that girl this is Chrissy Jones she's a yoga teacher and she's opening up a studio in Chinatown SkyTeam yoga yeah we set this whole Street up so we could get plugged Chrissy's I was looking to work with guitars right yeah normally I'm a super confident cyclist in this vlog but the roads are soaking wet it's been pouring all day if ever I'm going to fall it's going to happen today Candace's jewelry company is doing a super cool like sample sale where people get to go up into a showroom see her jewelry buy it and he has like a mariachi band there something crazy do you hear that I got you a present I'm Jay Goodis here birthday it's not your birthday why didn't I get that for you happy Tuesday because I'm lucky oh so pretty oh my god it's so pretty oh my god I hope you like it I love it okay we go over there party Oh this shot looks familiar it's because this is the same shot from yesterday's vlog because yesterday I came here because I thought yesterday was today go inside somebody said in the comments below that I need to be spending more time with my family and more time with Francine and I can only assume that means because they don't see enough of them in the vlog so I thought this is obvious but clearly not so let me just explain I apologize if this comes across as pedantic but my day just like your days my day is 24 hours long and these vlogs are usually eight minutes long so that means 23 hours and 52 minutes of each one of my days is not in this vlog and during those times I'm doing things like spending time with my family and more intimate things that I choose to omit from this law there's a lot of my life that exists outside of these eight-minute nuggets and I like to upload every day and also like this vlog for me isn't and has here with respect out isn't and has never been like a running daily journal for me what this vlog is for me is a way to like share my ideas and perspectives and have a conversation and chat in the comments and do Q&amp;A s it's a forum for me it's not a journal gotta go to the studio gotta get my bike got a ride to 13th Street big day ahead I think I never know so god this is gonna require a lot of blurring Matt and I both thought that we needed to give the team greater motivation to work harder and faster so this is this little kind of motivational art project I built this is where it gets awesome it's this scene I like that it doesn't get to that ouble below the idea is that it cuts the second the battles over you know friend of mine I don't know this is from these guys are awesome I broke the other one I'll see you later okay now I've got to get out of here I have to be in 13th Street at 9:00 a.m. it is currently 8:54 a.m. I have six minutes to get there mister Jehovah show some love you both owe me this is literally the first person I met when I moved to New York City 14 years ago how you doing how's the family I'm great I got two kids in the West Village right with Dylan Hendricks all honed their skills I recognized this genius years ago and I'm always proud when I see what he's up to you know I've got two kids no I reckon I know I know you got a family I lovely I saw Candace

lived in New York City for two full years before I ran into somebody I knew on the street and that's when New York City felt like home to me rather than this like scary city that I was visiting Wow full disclosure I don't really know what this event is that I'm going to right now I was invited to it it's some sort of panel or or roundtable discussion with a bunch of people that are far smarter more successful and generally better educated than I am I was looking at the invite list and it's all like architects and designers and politicians I think Al Gore former Vice President Al Gore is on that list but I was promised free breakfasts so of course I'll show up it's a pretty intimidating house last person here but I'm also not on time Thank You Casey you too well that was super fun some t-shirts and stuff but thank you get our food jackpot so this way it's very heavy you want hold it oh my god right you got to be strong morning um since being in Los Angeles I haven't had one night where I've slept more than like three or four hours because by the time I'm done with all my socializing and whatnot it's like midnight and then I start the vlog which I don't finish to like four or five and then I wake up at 8 today is no different and I really want to go back to bed right now but I have this deal with myself that whenever I'm out here no matter what I go for a run these stairs smell like pee Rose this is one of my favorite places in Santa Monica beach it's like an adult jungle gym so you have like these pull-up bars and all this stuff and then over here you have these crazy rings that these muscle dudes like swing from but my favorite my favorite are these it's so hard you got a really commit your clothes you talk good I'm using my shoe as a tripod so far apart they're made to Venice I have to turn around here I really wanted to go further but I'm out of time I wasted all my time on those at the jungle gym okay I'm gonna turn around now okay that's it good run I'm actually meeting someone will I be right now I don't know fellow youtuber who lives here in Santa Monica and I'm psyched to me good to see a man all right what are we going just going to find something to eat here thanks for bringing skateboards what did i order hmm please special ah seriously oh it does burn okay that's lunch how was it it was very good I feel like a new person you do realize that you got the most expensive thing on the menu I know and then Casey was like yeah I'm gonna faint I was like no you're gonna fake and I realized how much your lunch was I would have not hated you I would have not paid for my lunch either I'm doing something now that I'm a little bit nervous about Luther's going to come with me but yesterday I tweeted that I wanted 20 people to meet up with me here in Santa Monica and I'm going to put those people those 20 people on beam on my new company on our new app they're going to be like our first kind of public beta testers now I'm just like meeting these kids in a park so I have no idea what to expect no idea what's going to happen now I'm bringing this poor guy who I met 20 minutes ago I expect it to be like The Hunger Games I'm hoping this is nothing like the Hunger Games did you just say yeah of course I did you just paid my steak I have to fake your barking it I'll get the steaks you get the parking yeah fair enough we are going into the park now expectations you know what somewhat I think that you're doing so many things in so many different ways that this has to work what I mean god I hope you're right yeah and spot

we'll find out shortly hey guys are you guys excited what I mean I would really regret if I didn't get that if I could be on your blog I'd love to put you on the blog but paving the block and univox like in a log Chickie's the whole thing in a lot but thank you I just wanna say thank you to everyone for coming out today it really meant a lot I'm really excited for a beam really excited you know people making fun of me on the vlog it's gonna become a thing is that me - no that's me that's me okay do you put it there goes the last of our Meetup I think it was pretty successful what do you think yeah this is a myth by the way he's with us getting away well yeah they look like you what they were doing there's like a smart group of people anyways that's it that's like beam is now in the wild with those 23 people how's it feel they want the baby it's a little bit like dropping your kid off at school for the first time I don't know see yeah there's nothing I can do now that was a really big deal for me that was the culmination of like a year and a half worth of work for me and the entire team also the music you're hearing right now is not the sound bet for what I'm saying it's just like that speaker right then but I'm super like anxious nervous right now I don't know that's communicating this is Lana you are gonna be a lotta joined us for lunch dinner linor Leonard dunge okay let's hear it the skateboards and then I gotta go to the airport you need to get to the airport I gotta fly in time did I take up two parking spots or is it's not a parking spot I know I think I hear this right now but we ran out of quarters and what because it's not expired meter all right yeah we took two all at lunch this is the fifth ticket I've gotten Cadillac you can definitely invoice me for all these parking tickets thank you again for the car really sorry about the tickets Thank You officer uh-huh dude thank you there's the airport just about at LAX I didn't realize how late it was there's no threat of me missing my flight but there's a very real threat that I might not be able to take a shower in the airport which is pretty much my favorite thing to do there is Tom himself mr. Cal act yo thanks for the car how'd it work out great man lax is like one of two airports in the country that has like a secret bat cave entrance and actually is outside of the terminal is she mr. lesser nice chat thank you again go I'll see you later Tom All Right see ya geez thank you thank you made it for security no problem next stop airport shower do you have um showers we do shower done I'm clean ready for the flight down we put jobless on to try these things out second we've got to find out what's happening regrets good life that's great I know I don't want to hear that one of them Bigelow the sheriff I did that but I won't do you want to put the mouse on the other side I want to just look at that I want to look at like the pricing and regions page for a second make sure all this is saying okay it's 327 in the morning on what's the day today we are about to send beam live on the App Store globally right available wasn't all right click it it is alive fly we're officially live in the App Store how's that feel that feels pretty good today is a very very big day today's the day that the clothes come off today's the day I reveal every detail every aspect I show you what beam is how it works what the app looks like that's all happening now on this vlog you see social media it's supposed to be a digital or virtual version of who we are as people instead it's this highly sculpted calculated calibrated version of who we are told through filters that make our eyes bluer and carefully selected images to portray a version of who we are it doesn't really resemble the reality of things my team and I we've spent the last year plus building a new version of social a new way to share one that we feel bridges that uncanny valley real life is here social media is here and we're up here this is being all other social apps when you want to share a picture or video you go like this and instead of seeing the world with your eyes you're seeing it through your phone or they work like this where I'm staring at myself making sure I look a certain way and then when I stop recording like this where I'm staring at myself I get to scrutinize myself that's just it I'm not sharing the real me I'm sharing a version of me with bean we wanted to do something different we wanted you to be able to maintain eye contact we wanted you to be able to keep staring at the sunset and we wanted you to keep watching the rock concert while still letting you share so this is what sharing on beam looks like there's no staring at the phone you just hold it to your chest and it records and then it's posted that's it there's no preview there's no review and there's never need to look at your phone if you want to do a selfie you just stick it against the wall talk to the phone now to accomplish this we had to do some interesting things mainly we use the proximity sensor as our record button and this is what viewing looks like on beam these are all the people I follow these are all their beams and if I want to watch one you just hold down on the cell is my sister once it's over the beam is gone forever everything you see you see for the first time and you see for the last time and if you want to send feedback there are no thumbs-up and there are no hearts if you see something you like you just move your finger and send a real-time selfie my mom's gonna be so mad at me getting reactions is my favorite part of the app there's just something so satisfying about being able to see people actually watching what you shared being able to capture without being forced to stare at your phone is one of the most liberating interactions I've done since getting this device you'll find that we have nothing but the best and most positive ambitions for this platform if you look into Who I am if you look into who my team is you'll see that we're a collection of individuals trying to do something really positive trying to remove the self-awareness and the self-consciousness from sharing on social media so that's been I'm so psyched to finally be able to share with you exactly what it is what I've been working on what our vision is for it I'm really excited beam is in the Apple App Store today globally but I highly recommend you do not download it today we have a new version coming out next week that's much more complete and buttoned up I wait till then but I do want to talk about how you get access to beam because after you download it you're still not in you're locked out you can reserve a username but you don't get access to the actual app where you can post and you can view and we did that with good purpose we did that with good reason a social network is only ever as good as the users on that social network and beam in particular is a lot more fun with friends so how it works is you need to have an unlock code to unlock your beam to unlock your app and anyone who's in like me can unlock your app so what I'm going to do is I'm going to give an unlock code on this blog next week after we launch the new version and you the viewers will be the first to have access and it'll be fun they'll be like mission impossible with the password self-destructs after an hour or something so really only you the vlog watchers will have that first access and then you can invite your friends or whoever you want and then a community builds that way and typically when you launch apps it's all about getting as many downloads as possible but for us we much more want to focus on actually having people use the app that want to use the app not like people who download it and then never open it again that doesn't that's not fun for the community and that's why we have that unlock mechanism there if you can unlock your friend then both of you are in it and you can share with one another and that's just a lot more fun all right there's a lot more to talk about with being tomorrow's vlog is going to be solely dedicated to like a beam QA where we can like exhaust every question you might have alright I'm like sitting on our fire escape right now which is a very dangerous place to hang out and there are some people down there ok going to be a late night family came by to say hi so I get a little lovin before the night begins eighty likes jewelry just like her mom okay bye you to buy Fanny fun friend seems fun Candace hi Bonnie bye yeah okay there we go this is not a vlog this is not a vlog at all this is just like a little note before I'm a vlogger I'm a filmmaker and if you go back and you look at the first hundred films on this YouTube channel you will find a hundred films made by a filmmaker that is movies that took like a great deal of production a huge amount of time movies that I consider precious and the first phase of this YouTube channel or YouTube for me was about having a means of distribution for my films I got to thinking like earlier this year and I got really frustrated with how little content I was putting out and I really just rethought the whole thing enter this vlog and the vlog at first was just an exercise in what happens when I force myself to post every single day it was never meant to be sort of a log of what my life is the vlog takes like myriad manifestations sometimes it's just me talking to camera sometimes just me opening mail sometimes it's me going on a trip there is no one formula for this vlog so with that I want to talk about what I'm doing today which will be a separate video not this one and it is very far from what the vlogs have been yesterday I went to this event with my friend Roman and it was for a company called Rico and they're making a new 360-degree camera this by the way is absolutely not a plug I'm not being paid for this but they did give me the camera for free I don't really know what to do with it but I have seen the incredible videos that my friend Louie Cole has done I'll link those below you should check them out watch them in 4k they're amazing I saw a really crappy video that Roman made a few months ago using an older camera that looks like this film amount of potato and as crappy as the video was I still found it fascinating to watch so did like 8 million other people who watch the video that's also linked below so that's it today's vlog sure is going to be our day shot on these 360 cameras fancy titles no fancy music no fancy editing that's completely opposite of your kid be interesting we're doing in two parts one part of my channel one part on Romans Channel what else am i leaving out we're gonna do it all today one day I have no idea what to expect okay yeah I mean the best thing to remember is this is this is kind of the first of its kind this hasn't been mastered yet you know like we're pioneering it we're roaming saying is if this sucks bear with us this sucks it's my fault the camera company also makes this um what is that waterproof waterproof case for the camera I thought you guys would get a kick out 7:00 a.m. on a Saturday we're on a walk quick family trip to target did you bring a wallet we come here to get diapers shinza fine more toys yeah now you got a point let's get it yeah just get the whole band ya know that's what she needs or should I get the one that plays music no just get that let's go this will be the first time the baby will be in the Jeep with no roof she don't love it you're gonna love it Franny do you like it with no roof on the farm are you I'm good I got um why are you carrying on stacks of money I just wanted to get change for the bank for the place yeah so

describe as an emergency bathroom situation run some gas station in some town in between our departure and our destination okay Bobby Gigi okay everybody's doing fine Gigi went out for a walk obligatory rest stop snack break honestly this drive was a huge pain in the ass before we had a baby and with the baby it's like almost intolerable I totally don't drive out here anymore which is a bummer it's so nice to be out of the city in the summertime welcome to Connecticut what are you under beach feel what lon oh my god get over it no in a minute look at this baby she needs some sunshine Oh who's that who's there is there your big brother Owen here in the hoverboard how you doing thank you look at that lawn clean going to the beach now this will be my first time going to the beach in 2015 which is kind of crazy because when when I got this house eight years ago I literally would spend like 80% of my summer sitting on this beach and now it's like we're lucky if we make it here one or two days a month you hear that alarm I think that means I'm going too fast because well on the grass did you wake up good this is us yep whoa thank you this place is called Scott's lobster dock if you ever find yourself in New London Connecticut come here get the lobster roll telling your friend of mine and they will give you nothing parents watching the baby on the trampoline and Owen just got back don't drop it whatever you do don't drop it that is probably the most laborious way you could possibly put it in there but stick with it on you got it obviously we're gonna take my truck the movies tonight first I got to get it ready you had a nice shopping trip did you buy anything for me that is kind of a gift for me thank you close that baby don't forget to lock your door holy smokes is packed in I wouldn't say drastic world was a good movie about it's extremely satisfying put the ending was oh my god Casey hey I'm gonna finally be on a vlog all of us canteen Kingdom today's Father's Day so I can really run as far or as long as I want she can't get mad at me cuz it's like today's like my day go for a run get out to Brooklyn this is Brooklyn that's Manhattan and she knows that I'm talking about 13.53 miles at a 7:56 pace it's like hot and muggy and thick out today you look there is at the beach there he is at Christmas and I got him a BB gun he thought that was a ridiculous thing to get him that's him a couple months ago that was when we got our portrait taken at Walmart I don't know why we got our picture taken at Walmart but let's see there is on the official poster from HBO series there he is that's on Block Island when when he was really little this was I think the first time we ever went for a trip 2003 maybe 2004 when we went to Paris together this is a letter he wrote me now today is Father's Day I'm in the office but it's only because Candice and Francine are both taking a nap so I snuck over here for one minute for this special edition Father's Day vlog I want to talk about fatherhood specifically I want to talk about my son Owen you see Francine the baby on the vlog all the time and that's because she's a baby she ain't got no schedule but more so because she's always with us and she's always around and she's so damn cute I know no matter how bad the vlog is that I'll still get lots of thumbs-up if she's in it my son is seldom in the vlog and the reason why is he's got school he's got cross-country is got indoor track he's got outdoor track he's got his own social life he's got a car he's got a job he's got SAT prep he's got college prep he's got visiting colleges the kid is like you know is 17 he's almost an adult so the opportunities to include him in this vlog it's tough so I want to talk a little bit about him that's us on a waterslide I don't know where we are there but look how young that's us in Long Island that's own in Candice in South Africa now I say this and I feel like this is a cliched thing to say and a lot of parents say this but Owen is my hero a little bit of context so before I had Owen I was like I had run away from school I had like just gotten to nothing but trouble I was like in trouble police trouble in school trouble I was like selling pot at high school um I was a really bad bad kid and when we found out that she was pregnant when I found out I was having a baby I was 16 years old I remember thinking like this is my opportunity this is my purpose and that never changed that still to this day hasn't changed like the minute Owen was born which was 20 days after my 17th birthday I had a new singular focus in life and that was to provide this kid with the best life I could provide him with and when your motivation goes beyond just yourself that's when incredible things happen so everything I've been able to do in life I have only been able to do because of this kid because of Owen look I'm like 17 years old in that picture probably 17 or 18 here and this is maybe a little bit later maybe I'm 19 18 19 this is when we lived in a trailer park it's a great picture see with Francine it's going to be different that child will never know anything but a life of safety and security and privilege there was no money when Owen was born we lived in a trailer park after his mom and I broke up I like lived with a cook that I worked with in a restaurant like shared an apartment after I moved to New York when I'd be back in Connecticut with him we would stay in like the Attic of an office building my dad owned or we'd say my grandmother's house sometimes if I had like a little bit of money sometimes we'd sleep in hotels I was doing the best I could but it wasn't very good and through all that I through all that stuff like Owen was never anything but super super loving and supportive and the most wonderful kid so when I credit all this with him that's not like parental hyperbole I mean that like he was extraordinary he supported me through everything I've done by Francine bye-bye bye Candace all right let's move we're trying to be helpful and help Candace with our groceries but I think it might be missing our movie that's the movie theater okay the movie is sold out and now we're just gonna try to sneak into the wrong theater then theater were supposed to be yeah it's there you think we're too late started my beside and that's a free that's a pretty heavy it's raining too fatty we're good Manjula Oh silly girly wanker I don't know if we're supposed to go this way but let's try seems fun someone has a knack for finding alternative means of egress from movie theaters yeah yeah this clears it up okay Oh God how do we got it here locked such a labyrinth wrapped up in a maze doing it burgers it's been a lot of father's day I am exhausted

one have you joined it before no I hate running in groups look at that mess ha ha ha you know when you're in like a steam room at the gym or a sauna it's hard to breathe that's what the air feels like today in New York City it's like thick and we're supposed to this big beam meetup today we add a bunch of people to our beta group but it's supposed to pour out this afternoon so I'm not sure what impact that's going to have on today's planned activities was that thunder okay we have color we have a bit of a situation right now in that today we're doing the beam meet up but it's like supposed to there's a flash flood warning in effect for New York City so we're trying to come up with alternative locations like indoor locations to do this big meetup who came up with dollar pizza okay David here I came up with renting out the entire dollar pizza place which at first were like that's crazy expensive but the pizza is a dollar how much Pizza could they possibly sell in an hour you can tell it's coming right question for you how much would we have to pay you to shut down the whole store for one hour for us come on that's crazy there's no way you sell 2,000 slices of pizza in an hour 500 so we want unlimited pizza - it's gotta be fresh though gotten fresh that fresh pizza okay good now I think we're pretty close like a much seems like pretty he's calling the boss right now pretty good negotiation skills yeah I was impressed I was really good good boy four to five no one else in here except for you guys what's your name I'm Casey thank you all right Carlos Jackson to come back with cash we'll see you at 4:00 he'll see you in five minutes that was ridiculously easy I can't believe it you should do that every day on some of the better to go change you like those negotiating skills really I got the free drinks in the end yeah you yeah you just needed something you're like this one just something for free just let me leave here with my dignity whoa if that's not a sign from the heavens that we can't do this meetup outdoors okay I think we probably made the right decision about taking the meetup indoors also I'm about to go next door to our rented out $1 pizza joint for this meetup for beam so I just wanted to explain what these meetups are and why we're doing them the app is launching very soon and I'll explain the app in all its detail on this vlog before we launch but before we get there we need to know how it works and how people use it and what people liked about it and all that and we've been doing all this internal testing for a while and now we need like strangers like the people who will ostensibly be using this when we do launch how are they going to use it and that's what last week in Santa Monica was all about and that's what today and the pizza shops going to be all about but like we found all these people on Twitter so you never know what to expect when meeting these guys okay it's go time and just for the record I will not be eating any one dollar pizza today these guys here these are my bodyguards this is Colin Colin big bunches Colin's our iOS engineer this is Adam here he's also an engineer these people are pissed off the dollar

YouTube because he like is a reggae artist or something and he just asked me and I was like that's not it's not going to happen and I think he was really upset I didn't mean it like in a kind of way I just meant that I'm like trying to do something here and you're preventing me from doing that now I feel terrible it does get a little frustrating when other people expect other people I'm not going to say anything negative but just not feel bad alright gonna run the west side this morning all I can smell is weed right now it's 7:00 in the morning then all I can smell is weed who smokes weed

this stoop okay self-balancing unicycle all right like I think this is an electronic electric unicycle these guys said they were going to send anyone I was like don't cuz I won't promote it but there's no way I cannot put this in the vlog so they win okay this is ridiculous what are the instruction this you need a Ghana sure I can write a regular unicycle this thing amended panels on all this but it is use extreme caution read manual before use you got some things out of mind of its own there's no way we're doing this right Hopkins a fee my place take off how do you stop it they could stop he should definitely have a helmet all right the way to do is you lean forward as hard as you can several hours have passed since the outdoor motorized self-balancing unicycle episode matt has now come and beard the motorized self-balancing unicycle and is ragging it no instructions or hey you always had it this is amazing look at its oddly the food they are coming this way like a Segway again jacket so you lean on it Oh give her down productivity at 368 Broadway has grinded to a halt hey coming out are you saying nicely here later Jeff see how you seeing this thing by Laura I gave me you like this thing yeah I am an hour and a half late to get home and all Candice asked me was to get her a chocolate cupcake so I'm getting her four so I think then like everything is cool I also left my new motorized unicycle outside in the street by itself and I'm worried someone's gonna steal it I wonder if the unicycle is still out there yes almost home still got the cupcakes Casey oh so what's up okay wait a sec so that like I don't really know how to stop it it's my motorized unicycle it's how I get to him from work yeah this is my new transportation lives out here I can't bring it in the house alright unicycles you're gonna sleep outside no you have to go home you it's Saturday the city is it's a different place on the weekend the people look different they move different they walk different the commuters that come here to work aren't here they're sort of replaced by out-of-towners visitors that are in less of a rush the people who do live here they dress different on the weekends I don't know if I like it better or worse on the weekends I probably like it less I love the manic urgency that is a Tuesday morning at 9:00 a.m. in New York City and the weekends just lack that magic okay Saturday morning run got about an hour to get in this morning before 4:00 own whore own gets you every day for a run I got to cut it short there though whole family's in town today eight miles at a 720 pace you know I've been actually run like an extra half-mile if you counted all the times I put my phone down hit record run past it run past it run back pick up my phone then run again needs to be a way to track that look who's here hi Owen how's the train ride not headed to work today had to do it some snacks with the kids the big one the little one find some toy design now revived overpriced coffee pods now we're shopping for baby stuff join into the office but just for a minute I got the wife kids the in-laws in town today and it's a Saturday today is not a work day just going in for like two seconds and I'm leaving office no big deal that was less than an hour in and out like it never happened ting on she does look like a little demon shot look at those eyes she looks like there's a cute baby say I'm not a monster you can't go that way that's where I get in trouble this is the roof deck of our house which is kind of cool thought that the fun parts are not you're not allowed to be in where the fun parts are and the fun parts I do a lot of these time lapses in my vlog they really do an effective job of like moving the day along people ask me how I do them so here's a little here's a little house so I'm shooting in three two time right now on the roof of my apartment building I use this camera which is a Canon GX 7 I use this big this big big boy right here which is a Canon 5d Mark 3 with a pretty fancy lens this is like a maybe a five thousand dollar camera and then the very best results this is not a joke the ones that everybody's like how did you shoot that one are all shot on my iPhone this thing performs better with time-lapse using the time-lapse feature then even my most expensive camera and I'm using my wallet here to protect it from the wind so it doesn't get blown over so yeah there you have it my cell phone shoots the best time lapses this is probably the best one I got all day I'll use this in today's vlog here I'll just play it right now ready time lapse take forever tissue you hit record do it taking a shot and pour then wait I'm hiding in the hallway my mother-in-law is hosting a dinner party at our house tonight these things stress me out wish me luck bah-bah guys we get to see the safe travels come visit anytime FOMO that is fear of missing out there's very little of that when you're in New York City there's this there's always something happening here and that's like that's a very exciting thing to be around these guys behind me are smoking pot these guys here they gave me a dirty look when they saw me coming over with the camera a very infrequently get Starbucks on my way to work but today is just one of those days got my copy well Kassie got his topic so licious when Owen was a baby his favorite show was Blue's Clues and his favorite part of Blue's Clues was mail time when I was a kid my favorite show was pee-wee's Playhouse and my favorite part of that show was mail time we got a ton of it anyways mail time thank you thank you special visitor today hello youtuber that I've never met before driving the name of Mark Miller you just pay me ask you to come by I said sure yo how's it all come to the studio this is like any time I hang out any vloggers this is what M this is what ends up happening it's not become kind of a rite of passage but I'm encouraging mark here to try the motorized unicycle give me one - don't hold on to the seat even though it feels like you should yeah straight up bleep petit style like you're walking the tightrope good luck lean forward lean forward hands off oh my god nice sort of yes I'll see you guys on the Internet sorry I should give them the customary uh bullhorn goodbye so this week is our this week is Fleet Week and what Fleet Week is is it's it's like a way that City celebrates and shows appreciation for all the like sea services branches so like the Navy and the Coast Guard and all kinds of sailors this afternoon that had like a parade of all the boats coming into the city and I missed it because it works so it's super excited about boats and stuff so I'm trying to bike up to where they dock them so I'm gonna look at the boats this is what I sneak away from work to do that big guy lives here in the city he's always here that is a world war two aircraft carrier interesting anecdote that aircraft carrier was actually hit by three kamikaze planes during I believe the Battle of Midway hi welcome to New York Wow look at that thing I wish I could get closer but they have a lot of security which I understand but look this ship so I don't know what boat that is it's got an osprey tiltrotor on the back which is pretty amazing and it just looks like it's from the future look at this guy you would think there's a better method than to just stick a guy in the anchor wall with a stick with the hook on the end but kind of disappointed I didn't get to see more ships but I'm going to try hard tomorrow to actually see the parade when the ships come in that's why I was hoping to see so glad I went up there though it's kind of early I worked late last night so I'm trying to get home early today spend a little time with Francine before bed I hope she's still awake what was that I'm really nobody she was at people by sliggoo you know that scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom when all the slave children get let out of the dungeon and they see sunlight for the first time and they're like and then they're also happy that is what people of New York are like on the first warm day of the year which is today at first is late and then everybody's just so happy great day to be in the city good well we get a lot of stuff huh okay thank you thank you take care guys this is how you get your groceries and toilet paper and laundry detergent in New York City have fun shopping have fun shopping with mommy don't find anything all right we'll have fun bye Candice is taking the baby for a walk I learned the Jim super quick it's amazing out today I want to go for a run but I just don't have the time totally bumped me up also right now I'm using a cop car as a tripod look that's probably at

really rad guy he's made some awesome videos I'll link them below and you should definitely follow him on snapchat and check him out on vine and finds our amazing super positive super funny stuff oh good to see you I'm good Jerome has tired my camera I don't know where he's going I don't know what he's saying but the man has my camera and he's taking off with it you know and you're friends with a guy like Jerome you just have to expect things like this to happen okay I have to say something but I don't want to say it in front of Kacie so as I took his camera for a minute I think we can all agree that Casey's vlogs are a revolution it's like it's like the French Renaissance and I've been clearly completely addicted to these vlogs like I never watch anything I never I never watch TV I recommend everybody to never tuning TV they watch all these crappiness but I'm completely addicted to Casey's life which is amazing and so well told and with so much honesty anyway Thank You Casey keep doing this Jerome it's 9:40 7:00 p.m. I'm up editing and I just saw your clip for the first time thank you that is a generous compliment especially coming from someone like you now usually I'm just up the slate editing but I actually have a commitment later tonight it's 947 and I saw another hour before I have to leave the house okay quarter of midnight come on my bicycle here's what's going on on the roof of a hotel in Soho and I'm here with the Voges een vogue invited me to some sort of fashion party tomorrow night and I'm going to make a video for them but tonight they're doing like a fitting and they asked me to come they said it would be fun and that's what's going on right now I'm just very tired but it is kind of fun so now I'm signing a release you are you read this carefully I will do this that they're doing a lot of the shooting with selfie sticks and iPhones which is kind of amazing and I'm like helping them with advice as to how to shoot with iPhones apparently that's my specialty aside from I don't think so why did I have to say like they look incredible Wow one two three it's almost tonight and it's an action for the Midgard and again yes in one hour to get one line shot on an iPhone with a selfie stand look at these fashion people with their cigarette butts look at that just cigarette butts all over the ground this isn't France you put your cigarette butts in the garbage how dare 1:30 in the morning finally heading home I'm not much of a late-night kind of guy but that was pretty awesome and I'm glad I hung out for who are these guys trouble so this thing like this makes you go forward this makes you go backwards and then like go superfast it's a brushless motor you can you can like put it in reverse a little bit and it'll slow you down long but it's not safe it's so scary in the city early run today I'm trying something new I tweeted out for people to ask me questions about running I'm going to answer those running questions throughout my run this might be a really bad idea to actually wanted to get a good run in this morning but all right standing in the mill the Westside Highway first question what keeps you from quitting for me I just love it why would you ever quit something you really love okay back to run okay I'm Canal Street now next question how did I get into running I used to run a little bit in middle school on cross-country but I didn't really get into it until I broke my leg in 27 places and the doctor said I'd never run again the best way to really challenge me or most people is to tell them they can't do something that's how I got running okay okay next question Casey how do you wake up so early to run let them almost up like two hours it always feels better to sacrifice like an hour of sleep for an hour of running I have more energy throughout the day and like learning that overtime really makes it easy to jump out of bed knowing what he's ahead of it which is it off and run Casey what vlogging camera to use when you run I used to just use my iPhone but now I use this GoPro session this little guy and I have my doubts about this camera when you're Pro sent it to me but I gotta say it's pretty amazing I learned my lesson you never doubt GoPro all right that concludes my run and that distance really frustrates my OCD I could have gone like another 100 feet and it would have been an even a okay that's all I hope you enjoyed today's running Q&amp;A I'm headed into the office this morning just for a minute I have to check on the team make sure everything's good and then I'm going back out to Connecticut to go back to the hospital just like yesterday although slightly less stressful today because anyways going to check on the team now hey what's up I'm missing the important yesterday besides your haircut just the haircut I saw it on beam did I miss anything important yesterday no I see this is coming along Colin yeah still don't like those odds okay so we're going to Frank and sign them and cannibalize them and get them one of them up and running guys have a good weekend Godspeed see you later later Jack Han Casey been combat Alex we're all those guys in there you're doing a stuff or something and keep time he's been waiting here for two days I like been out of town by us yesterday I drove to Connecticut to visit someone in the hospital the drive is a total stress out I'm going to take the train today which is also a stress out but I'm hoping less stressful than driving plus it means I get to ride my skateboard to Grand Central Station alright next stop for in Central Station I'm about to get on Park Avenue which might be the most dangerous scariest road to ride a bike on let alone an electric skateboard I'm going to go extra careful here the helmets going back on now I'm doing it I'm doing it yeah okay that was crazy completely unnecessary extremely dangerous and probably illegal but I just couldn't resist going through the Park Avenue tunnel on the skateboard made it to Grand Central Station I'm still alive made it out of 20 seconds to spare the conductor was not amused at my electric skateboard sky right here he's beaming was beaming okay I'm just arriving in New Haven Connecticut to go to the Yale New Haven Hospital not sure what's going to happen but I'm not gonna be blogging I'm sure you understand I wonder if this guy knows that his Porsche has a flat tire I'm sure nothing Oh breaking the office running late this morning have a meeting very early today Oh today's Tuesday that's questions and answers say roll the intro alright let's get started her the questions alright what is freedom I think I stole this from Bob Dylan but maybe I stole this from Woody Guthrie freedom for me is waking up in the morning and going to sleep at night and in between doing exactly what I want to do only Cynthia wants to know KC if you weren't a filmmaker what would you be if I wasn't making movies I'd either like to be an astronaut or a professional athlete or I I don't really know all I've ever known is making movies Chris wants to know how much longer do you think you can keep your vlog going I don't know how much longer I can sustain this but I can tell you like each day I invest deeper into it which makes it harder for me to stop what's the secret to happiness the secret to happiness is finding something you love and then doing that for the rest of your life I stole that from Rushmore so you can add a little on I think you just got to find something you love to do and then do it for the rest of your life Jonas wants to know are you afraid of running out of stories to tell no in the book I said shotgun Cameron wants to know what is your favorite book my favorite book is The Autobiography of Malcolm X I've read that book like three times twice in a row and you can pretty much learn everything you need to know about life in that book Rebecca wants to know film school or no film school what's the best way to make a career in the film industry the truth is there are no defined paths in the film industry meaning if you could go to school and be taught here's how to succeed in the film industry everyone would do it because this is the greatest job ever what it takes is defining your own path the best piece of advice I have for someone trying to succeed in the film industry or any creative space is if you're doing what everyone else is doing you're doing it wrong do you snapchat less now that you do the daily vlogs no Gavin wants to know what is your new business how about this Gavin I will talk about my new business in tomorrow's vlog I'll talk about in a little there's like look there like all these cars and trying to record audio my Q&amp;A and all I can hear is a helicopter buzzing hell is going on here that's what was interrupting my QA there appears to be some sort of protest going on not sure what this protest is but I will find out so this is a protest against police brutality in response to the recent police killings of unarmed African American I gotta say I really like seeing this happen in my town especially because like the cops are out here walking with the protesters it's all peaceful this is one of the reasons why I love New York City I am all right that's it I'm cutting the QA I'm cutting the Q&amp;A short rule our new coffee machine is here holy smokes this thing is heavy yes it's our new coffee machine so psyched pretty relentless day in the office another ten and a half hour day I'm on my way to Penn Station now I've got a jump

of blow and I like the smell and nobody ever comes down this way is it dangerous it's not dangerous it's just people don't know to come down here but look how disgusting this is is like packed upstairs but empty down here New York City has two train stations and if Grand Central Station is the beautiful tulip of the city Penn Station is New York City's anus absolutely disgusting now the analogy that should be in textbooks Sean yeah you're the only friend I know that would meet me at Penn Station to hang out before my ride awesome to see you it's not true thanks buddy enjoy your time in New York so this is a two and a half hour train ride to southeastern Connecticut the New London Connecticut you're leaving us tonight New London Connecticut please take the remaining time to gather

right now I have to be up at 4:30 tomorrow morning to drive to Boston so I think that is my day Oh on my way to the gym you might notice how fresh I looked this morning Candace's mother slept over last night and took care of the baby I wish that happened every night hi Francie Oh closet the day of reckoning is near but not today it's raining hey when it rains it makes it so hard to vlog my camera gets all wet today is Tuesday that means it's questions and answers day roll the intro questions and answers volume two let's go Angela wants to know does canister Owen ever get tired of you filming them all the time Candace yes Owen not really he's a total sport what's the biggest difference between raising Owen and Francine I was really poor when Owen was born and when you don't have any money or have any options I'm no longer really poor and now there are a lot of options and in some weird ironic way it makes it harder to raise children when you have options then when you don't have options when do we get to know what the new businesses I promise I'll talk all about my new business which is really exciting in this vlog at some point in time I just need like this much more time Annabelle wants to know how many cameras do you have how many cameras I have here I'll show you I'll show you some of them I have way way too many cameras this is like this is some of them these are all my point-and-shoot cameras these are all my camera batteries and chargers these are a couple but not anywhere near all of my SLRs these are my some of my lens those are some of my retired cameras even older cameras big camera these dinosaurs up there it's another retired camera so the answer is way way too many cameras what keeps you motivated what keeps me motivated well in short I'm here all of my dreams and aspirations are here and the only thing in between these two is a bunch of work so tackling that work is a way of moving this needle that's all the motivation I need love progress in any manifestation yeah motivations never I've never struggled with motivation ever here's a great question what question are you tired of being asked my least favorite question is what did you shoot that on dear Casey what camera do you use to shoot your vlogs that's appropriate so I use mostly this little point and shoot but then I also use this camera here which is called a Canon 70d it works really well for vlogging you're a filmmaker stop vlogging not actually a question but I am more than happy to address I premiered feature films at the Cannes Film Festival I premiered a feature at the Sundance Film Festival I have written directed edited and started my own HBO series I've been awarded the Rockefeller grant for filmmaking I've stood on stages and received prestigious awards and I'm a lifetime member of the Sundance Institute and I can tell you that that this that creating a new movie every 24 hours and releasing that movie to an audience of hundreds of thousands of people is an evolution in filmmaking see our job as creators is to further define any medium our job is to create the new cliches not adhere to those that that were defined by generations past and to suggest that this is anything but filmmaking is is to is to highlight some preconceived falsehood around what the very definition of filmmaking is with that I'm going to end the Q&amp;A there we will now return to our regularly scheduled blog so good morning jack morning I actually don't have to put bricks together and this was not easy for me little bit further right I feel like I feel like

what's going on over here she said and I quote that's disgusting to which I replied what are you talking about she said right there Casey those two that's disgusting does it bother you it is uh 7:30 on a Saturday night and I didn't really vlog today I didn't um I didn't do any of like my normal vlogging I didn't really do much of anything today well Francine and I let Candace sleep in and we went to Starbucks we're going to get some Starbucks isn't that right Francine yeah that's right Joanie I really don't know why there are laws that get these jackhammers like all right what do you want to get I'll get our usual double espresso she really does smile this much she always smiles then we went for like a good old-fashioned father-daughter walk this is old-fashioned father-daughter walk then Candace and I brought Francine to the park and there was a first we're at the park with the baby she's about to go into the swing - the first time it says two to five year old Candace uh and that was kind of it and I'm at home and I realized it was seven o'clock almost seven o'clock and I forgot to shoot a vlog today and I thought for a second I was like well maybe just I take the day off and I thought instead why not make a quick vlog which is what this is about why I decided to vlog and it's a pretty simple answer it's it's between starting my new company and having a baby and all these other responsibilities in life i I really slowed down my filmmaking I stopped making movies often because there was always a really good excuse not to make a movie just like today I have a really great excuse why not to make a vlog for today but if today is a case study for why I'm doing this vlog the purpose for me the need for me to make a vlog every day is to keep a fire lit under my ass to always do to always create because if it's like make a vlog when I can then it becomes this battle between my want to do it and all these great excuses that my brain can come up with as to why I shouldn't do it and any time there's an opportunity to embrace excuses I will always embrace the excuse rather than actually executing on it so a daily vlog means a daily vlog means a daily vlog and if I called it anything else like a weekly vlog or three times a week blog or anything but daily I might not be creating on the same level that I'm creating right now so that's why I shifted my channel is because I needed an impetus I needed something that forced me to be creating all the time that is what this channel now is and that's what this vlog is all about and right now I'm on the roof of my apartment building because because Candice is taking a nap and Francine went to bed and I didn't want to go back to the office it's also kind of amazing up here just anecdotally the best part of the roof is over here and I went up there once and posted an Instagram picture of myself up there and then we got a fine from the building management because I'm not allowed up there like a very expensive fine so I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with this roof okay that's it that's Saturday's vlog ah yo Marlon you have a good weekend enjoy it alright enjoy it I wanted to say alright get that shot for not very long clearly we're shadowing is something that's done in the storytelling when they allude early in this story to what might happen later in the story tonight Candace and I may or may not take a train to Connecticut which would be a really great ending for the blog so if that happens cool if it doesn't happen the blogs just need like the normal blog to do and just forget I said this whole bit are there or are there not kids waiting outside of my office this morning there are yo what's up homie how are you I'm good I'm good good before I begin today's vlog in earnest I have a bit of an announcement to make which is that I said that I would be monetizing my channel at some point in time I just wasn't sure when that time is now I'm going to be monetizing soon the reason why is not that complicated Owen goes to college next year I don't know to pay for college maybe this is a viable solution sorry add suck I'm so sorry to put you through that but you know is what it is so that's all we're gonna ride bikes okay no I got a bike for you like I'm not right Jack I'm not around a mid feather but you gotta guard two bikes David we got one

to Texas goodbye family I hate goodbyes today kind of sucks Candace and Francine are going to Texas this morning I'm not going to see them again till Sunday so that's kind of a bummer I'm leaving town tomorrow morning so I'm not going to get work tomorrow so after all tomorrow's work today that's kind of a bummer so today's vlog starts out with kind of a couple of Downers it's currently 9:00 a.m. it's now 6:30 p.m. and I am headed home yeah the entire day just went by it's nighttime now I'm bringing the state I didn't shoot the vlog at all today but it doesn't mean I'm not shooting a vlog today I'm actually very excited about the fact that I'm going to be shooting the vlog tonight and that's a rare opportunity one that I never actually have who's home a little puppy a little puppy hi oh my god it's so cute see you're acting cute okay do your dance good girl good girl see my nights are always exactly the same and what that consists of is I race home before the baby goes asleep I usually give her a bath I help Candice give her a bath and then baby goes to bed Candice and I order takeout and that's kind of it I usually sit in the corner edit my vlog Candice watches TV that's what you do when you have a baby but wife and kiddo are gone tonight I'm here alone so I made a decision that rather than working late and coming home and doing nothing there do something special tonight which is like go out and enjoy this beautiful summer night on like the skateboard and maybe shoot some time lapses or something like that and that's what today's vlog is going to be so looks like the Sun setting which is kind of disappointing I was hoping to get some of that awesome yellow light see I've got the boosted board they're doing double duty it is uh right now serving as like a marker here so cars see me and they don't hit my camera I'm shooting the World Trade Center which is right there that little girl right there walked by and said is this a movie set I'm headed to the water proper now to see if the Sun is completely set but there's some cool light or I don't know it's just awesome down there I'm going to set up before it gets dark out that's my mark three that's my 70d there I don't remember the last time I had like a guilt-free night out alone I missed the kid I miss Candace but it's kind of nice having a little time to myself it really makes me think like I don't know the last time Candace's had a night alone like this year so I don't know how she hasn't freaked out yet all right it's getting pretty dark now I got like 10 good setups I'm going to go for a quick boosted board ride before it gets pitch black then go to Whole Foods then go home I'm starting to get blog anxiety vlog anxiety is a condition that happens every night after 8 p.m. if I haven't started the vlog yet it makes me tense and my hands are clammy and the only cure is to get home sit in front of my computer and start this edit after I get some snacks that is that's it we're good I'm very nice okay this is a good evening it is 9 p.m. I'm heading home you sleek car man I'm running the Brooklyn this morning I am seven miles out in Red Hook Brooklyn that's where I started right there I haven't been running as much as I should be lately I have the New York City Marathon in like six weeks I haven't trained at all I need to get my together whoa check this out those are two military helicopters flying in formation okay now's eleven point two miles at a 7:58 pace had to cut it short cuz I'm late for work story of my life love always waiting for you kinda feel glamorous today oh really I do I by 11 miles not a bad run this morning but not where I should be considering the marathon is so soon tough summer with training because of work and the baby starting today I'm going to give greater priority to my running and training diet and all that stuff if I give greater priority to my running and training diet and all that stuff especially my diet my diet has been particularly egregious of late let me uh let me walk you through what I've been eating you see over at bean headquarters we kind of have an unlimited snack selection and I have an affinity for snack so that's probably been the biggest offender I get usually starts with a bowl or two of honey nut cheerios always honey nut never the regular Cheerios because regular Cheerios clearly don't have enough sugar then in between breakfast and lunch I usually have like one of these and maybe one of these which is a little salty so I complement that with one of these and then I usually have a reasonable lunch and what that means is basically whatever Ally orders me so yesterday that was a sandwich the day before I think it was Vietnamese or Thai food you know like a normal lunch then for an afternoon snack I'll usually have a warm D my Nana used to give these to me I eat a lot of this this is my favorite snack but there's no way it's healthy the quantity that I consume I usually have a couple of these or sometimes if I'm feeling adventurous I will have one of these and then throughout the entire day I'll usually have a sprinkling of GG's this skin you know I really enjoy sugar from time to time that's why half of my teeth are rotting out of my head it's one of our can disorders me which is take out and then usually I have Lucky Charms on top of that that's it that's that's that's what I eat and that's not good so starting right now for the next three days I'm going to swap all of this out and just rank this stuff and what you're looking at here is your classic overpriced organic raw vegan juice for three days that's the idea now I'm no dietitian I'm no expert but pretty sure if I drink nothing but this stuff for three days my system will be cleansed and then I can go back to my normal diet remember yesterday me complaining about the noise pollution what is going on when I go check it out what is happening here there's dollar pizzas on fire whoa they've been blocking all of Broadway Jerome's going to show me something it can't be included in today's vlog he's going to show me I'm gonna bleep all this out no don't even say it ok sorry guys Jerome and I are now in a walk it's a walk and talk we're trying to figure out how to make a movie about this thing that we can't talk about can't talk about it sorry that I have to say to you that we can't talk about something but we really can't talk about it it's not my call what is going on over here dude if a Ghostbuster car take care guys that right there is the fire house from Ghostbusters and those guys I guess just have their own Ghostbuster mobile twos press yeah all of those are mine there's two more yeah thank you healthy you later thank you later drum I'll see you tomorrow tomorrow we shoot boosted board hates cobblestones Jerome and I are making YouTube video tomorrow a video for his channel not for my channel for the video that he doesn't want me to talk about that's our big secret drones one of my closest friends so I'm sorry I can't divulge the secret but it'll be on YouTube soon enough it's 6:00 p.m. I'm a full day into nothing but juice I'm not hungry I'm just like angry stay stay good girl where do you wanna go where do you want to go little me Freddy any get some food some people food watermelon I am getting food here but the food I'm getting is just a salad which is technically solid juice so I don't think it's cheating I'm still on the whole juice thing No I'm gonna taste it franciene we know you're faking it time for your bath and then you go to bed time for bath and bed what's up everybody my name is Kinetico and this is my friend Joey we both go to college in Illinois a pretty fun fact about me and why you should follow me on beam is I've

my name is Joey I'm baby kanga and beam I like adventure II stuff and I'm an art major and you should follow me on because we're about to go on hit the dirt jumping track with my boy Jeff after your

running to the gym really quick and by running I mean taking the electric skateboard then I'm going to catch back up with the women hope they're open tonight I hope they're open say I hope they're open today uh-oh we're good I never get more than a half a step right up agenda I just hate a few weights some pretty serious downhill not many Hills like this in New York City you want to race think I'm probably faster than that yellow car all right maybe not got him down are you ready you ready Joe okay come on ready yeah ready like we're not the only ones that have this idea we're gonna leave the baby hey Frannie look at her she's like a princess in her chariot comfortable there it's a choo-choo train okay don't care your dog was puking don't let her eat the grass okay all right just is that you're a penny board up there yeah can you give me a ride back to my house I want to I want to try that okay so just hold on right I got okay okay that's full throttle forget up to speed careful decoding I wonder how many people you could pull that's a great bus all right good luck don't go dying on me hey hi sorry for the interruption I was just shooting that on the skateboard I'm halfway through the shot my new camera cut out this is my new camera it's a Sony rx100 mark 4 it's like a $900 point-and-shoot camera and typically I only use Canon of how to destroy some they aren't perfect but they're reliable and they work all I get is this error message see that our message try to change it nothing stuck in this just pisses me off I think I'm gonna go back to my old canon g7x which doesn't have the picture quality of this thing but at least it never leaves me hanging Oh show me I wanted to love this thing was wrong with you ok back to our whatever's going out in the blog right now we're going to feature the baby's crawled about a quarter of a mile she started here then traversed over here back down here over here up here around here around there then up to here where she's currently holding court I think she's ever going to stop to crawl home teaching Francine how to vlog you can do it oh no no you have to look into the camera and say hey guys what's up what a vlogger sailing that with granny you got to talk into the camera hold it up right this this baby would make a terrible vlogger just a super quick update on the little tirade I went on before got it working again I don't know whether or not to go back to it I'm not mad anymore you know that thing like when your girlfriend or your boyfriend cheats on you and you hate them you say you'll never speak to them again and then like you sort of forget about it and miss them and fool me once shame on anyways I think I'm gonna go back to the Sony it's just like the image quality is so much better than the Canon even though the Canon never lets me down and the Sony well bye-bye Frannie you're stuck with me lady have a fun night with granny you keep that on come on wait I don't know what movie to watch Oh are there any I'm turning this ones and we're off bye bye so where we going um yeah I'll eat everything does that mean I have to pay let me guess you didn't bring your mom like I like okay that's

can to say something oh and say something good about this restaurant has good food okay there's your endorsement East Coast taco hey sorry again for the interruption it's tomorrow but see these little wavelengths these little mountains this is the audio up until this point in the vlog and then after that there's just nothing no audio to speak of all the way through I'm sure it was my fault I just want you to know the rest of the vlog is going to be like a montage because once again I totally dumped the audio I'm pretty excited about this new camera I think it looks great can you tell him on my hoverboard thing people really stare at you on this thing if it wasn't for one step in the lobby of this building I could make it from my bedroom to my desk in my office without getting off this thing it's no secret that New York City is my favorite place on planet earth I love this city I'm borderline obsessed with this city that said this city is also a stinking rotting just cesspool of Filth and nothing brings out that stank worse than the summertime and today it's like 91 degrees out and the whole city just kind of smells like it sort of smells like if someone hid a dead fish under the driver's seat of your car and then you rolled up the windows and left it parked in the Sun for like a week and it just smells like that everywhere I'm kind of psyched on the quality of this camera in yesterday's vlog there was a minor incident with my previous vlogging camera wherein the camera did not survive and I replaced it with this camera this camera is the cheapest Canon SLR that has autofocus it's just a rebel and yes I know I had nothing but bad things to say about Canon and I still believe that but like I've got 50 of their lenses and I'm like sucked into their ecosystem so I continue to buy their product I am a sucker I realize this but always anxious to hear your thoughts just for viewing this stuff it actually looks like the focus is a little soft morning welcome hi guys so these guys are in the office here because they're being put on the beta for the new company these are our test recruits you guys ready for your testing yeah nervous little nervous I like your lab reeks you are my lab rat and you're gonna keep in touch hush until the time is right thanks guys thanks guys yeah you guys want to ride it you want to get on it I do want to get on proactivity has

finally do the QA roll the intro [Music] also there's a garbage truck outside today doing whatever it is garbage trucks food so if the sound is terrible I apologize there's nothing I can do if I've never answered any of your questions one I'm sorry I try to find questions that have like questions that challenge me a little bit ones that I think the answer will be interesting to a broader audience than just the person who asked it okay Chris wants to know will you continue vlogging after your new businesses up and running I hope so one of the reasons why I started this vlog is because my new business is taking so much of my time that I wasn't making any movies so by having a vlog it's a way for me to talk about my business it's a way for me to make sure I keep making movies and it's just a way of like keeping me engaged with something I really love so I hope to maintain this as long as I can if my business starts to suffer I'll back off on the vlogs but that's up to me to to control so I like to think I can figure it out besides the Empire State Building what's your favorite building the Chrysler Building I know average how long does it take you to put together your vlogs I don't know if you mean like post-production like editing anywhere between like 2 and 7 hours to edit these things I do it at home at night in my apartment in my underwear but I can't take the sound I'm moving my Q&amp;A operation that's just to okay better quiet back here Chloe Donald wants to know what's your least favorite thing about New York the noise pollution there's no silence anywhere in this city any hour of any day Adam wants to know tell me how to succeed as in motivation I can't tell you that you have to find your own motivation can't rely on other people Andrew wants to know how do you surround yourself with the right people that's a great question I don't know how to surround yourself with the right people what I do is like eliminate the bad people if you're somebody that I don't want in my life get out what's the bump on your daughter's head her birthmark it'll go away poor thing amazing how often I get asked the same questions can you watch the other q and A's before you ask your question please how do you not give a shit about what anyone thinks and just do your own thing that's a two-part answer - a two-part question the first part about how do you just do your own thing in life you have two options you can do your own thing and stand out or you can do what you're supposed to do you can do what everyone else does and you can fit in there's nothing wrong with fitting in but you're fitting into cultural or societal norms that were created by other people now in some cases these norms are great but in others they don't make sense these norms these rules were created by someone someone just like you or someone just like me I don't know who created these norms chances are they weren't anyone smarter than you or me and if I'm not a fan of the way things are I just do my own thing because I trust myself and I trust my perspective more so than that of other people part two how do you not give it about what people think of you hmm I should preface this answer by saying I definitely got made fun of a lot for the way that I look when I was in school and all those bullies that picked on me are all losers now so never forget that people who judge others especially people who judge others based on things like looks on whether you're black or white whether you're Jewish or you're Muslim whether you are gay or straight because of their body type whether they're fat or skinny whether you have pimples or whether you have a big butt these judgemental people their opinions don't matter because they don't matter judgmental people are of a lower moral authority than those who don't judge and we people who don't judge we have a responsibility to crush to destroy those mean judgemental bullies and we do that with an overwhelming positivity and we do that with our extreme open-mindedness and when you subscribe to those those values you really stop caring what other people think because chances are if other people are judging you they're wrong Gordon wants to know could you convince Candace to do your vlog one day actually this morning tried to convince her to let me do a whole vlog about her so I'm working on it Candace is great in these vlogs and she's so pretty but I understand she gets a little shy sometimes alright I gotta stop I'm gonna stop my Q&amp;A there hope today's Q&amp;A was interesting more Q&amp;A again next week
