One of my greatest ambitions in life
Is for my nephews to consider me their favorite uncle.
No, I'm totally- sort of kidding.
Which is why, today, we've got a trampoline, a real nice high speed camera, and
1,500 water balloons including a couple really big ones

So I want to give a quick shout-out to Squarespace for helping to make this video possible.
So a while back I had an idea for an invention where if you added a cheap IR camera to your microwave
you could have a screen on the front. So instead of guessing you could actually see when your frozen burrito was done cooking.
You could even monitor your soup from the phone in another room and so if it wasn't all one color yet you could just add a little extra time.
So, instead of doing the Kickstarter thing which so often ends in disaster,
I made a really simple website where people can see the video and then sign a petition to show their interest
which I could then show to investors along with the patent.
So that amazing-looking website took me all of 30 minutes to make because I used Squarespace.
I personally used them three or four times, and I am amazed each time at how professional and customizable the final product is.
So if you have an awesome idea you want to launch or you just want to showcase your business
or maybe a hobby, you can use the link in the description or go to Squarespace.com/MarkRober for a free trial

so my favorite class in high school was physics
it opened my eyes to the fact
that we can understand and predict so
much of the everyday world around us
using math and equations
so today i wanted to revisit the classic high school
physics egg drop competition where you
have to build some sort of contraption
around an egg to make sure it doesn't
crack when it hits the ground.
Originally I wanted to do a bunch of research and
testing to find the single best way to
win the competition every time
But what I found out with that each competition
sort of has different rules in some
you're not allowed to use popcorn or
parachutes and in others you win if your
contraption is the smallest or the
lightest or both so i'm going to show
you five super easy options and then
we'll talk about why each one works
let's go crack some eggs
okay so let's start with the popcorn
ball the basic principles that you put
your egg in the middle of a box that
contains some kind of cushioning
materials such as bubble wrap or packing
peanuts or popcorn personally I think
this one is the most boring but it works
and that's why every shipping company
ever ships this way.
I'm using a ball here because it's more weight efficient
than a box, where you have unnecessary
cushioning in the corners plus the
stretchiness of the ball will help
absorb some of the energy
the moment of truth and we have an
intact egg now before I show you the other
four ideas let's talk about the science
behind landing with an uncracked egg
so at the start of your drop your egg is up
high and it's stationary so it has
potential energy which is the energy
associated with height so these red
blocks represent the potential energy
and the higher I go the more blocks of
energy I start and then as the egg falls,
that potential energy is converted to
kinetic energy which is the energy of
speed so you start up high and every
single block is over here as potential
energy but as you start to fall and fall
faster and faster every single block
comes over here is kinetic energy or
speed and now your egg is about to
impact the ground and have all this
energy in the form of speed that's got to
go somewhere now this broom represents
the standing energy that holds an
eggshell together it makes it hard so
the way to think about this is when your
egg hits the ground do you introduce
more energy than the binding energy of
the molecules holding the hard eggshell
together at any point you're going to
break at that point so the question then
becomes what can we do to keep our
blocks below the broom because simply
put below the broom your egg is safe
anything above the broom and your egg is
busted well there's two things we can do
the first is that we can make this pile
of green blocks not as tall this is why
no matter what your contraption is to
protect the egg if your rules allow it
you should make a parachute the bigger
the better and it does not have to be
fancy this is like old-school army guys
style just cut up
bag little bit of string little bit of
tape and just looking at this you can
see the difference a parachute could
make so the second thing you can do is
not to remove any green blocks by
reducing your speed but to spread them
out so if we say left to right as our
time axis the more we could stretch out
this impact event the more we can lower
that high energy spike and this is a
cool way to think about any two objects
impacted the longer the duration of the
impact the more you can spread out that
force so stuff doesn't break so for
example this is the point of car air
bags instead of your head hitting the
steering wheel and stopping near
instantaneously it stretches out the
impact force overtime so you don't get a
quick spike that exceeds the broom line
for your skull this is exactly why long
jumpers prefer to land it's sand and not
on asphalt and why parkour runners will
always roll after a big jump it's all
about defusing the force over a longer
period of time so what does that mean
for our egg contraptions it truly is
something to keep in mind because it can
make it more intuitive for example to
see why putting your egg in the middle
of a jar of peanut butter which is a
popular and not a very good idea isn't
as good as putting your egg in the
middle of a popcorn ball okay back to
the bridge
so a lot of people like to build
contraptions out of straws and in some
competitions that's all you have to work
with how you configure your straws
depends a little bit on how stiff they
are the good folks at wendys have fairly
stiff straws which means I didn't have
to use quite as many
so my idea was to
take six like three inch long straws and
build a regular triangular pyramid and
then put the egg in the middle
And then I took two of the Wendy straws and join
them together to sort of make a mega
straw and I use this wide tape to help
prevent it from buckling
and then I made six of those mega straws and simply
taped one to each edge of the pyramid
So the main point here is that there are no
straws pointing directly at the egg when
it impacts the ground the force goes up
the stiffness path through the straw I
saw a ton of examples online where the
straw was actually pointed at the a we
could create a puncture load in our case
we have this pyramid so all the loads
pass next to the egg so you don't get
that primary impact three two one
So you'll notice we've got a couple of
broken pieces but that's okay because it
took energy to make those breaks and
that sort of protect the shell of the
egg and receiving that energy so success
ok so our egg finally broke but it took
about 20 tries and you can see there's a
lot of busted straws here all in all it
was pretty resilient
so this one is a throwback to my NASA
roots in 2004 the emmy our Rovers landed
on Mars using giant airbags and even
though Mars has one-third the gravity of
Earth I figured it would still work
I started by cushioning the egg in four
little balloons that I barely filled up
and then I blew up bigger balloons and
then just tied it all together with some
string and tape and then if there's any
gaps in coverage you can just tape a
balloon directly to the stream you just
tied around
in addition to the balloons
extending the impact time this design
benefits from a large cross-sectional
area relative to his weight so in a
sense it becomes its own parachute
Of course if your rules allow it you should
still throw an additional parachute on
it anyways
"Touchdown Confirmed, We're safe on Mars"
*cheering*
Music
I'm 2012 we landed another rover on Mars
called curiosity but this one was too
big to use airbags so we had to have a
power to send pretty much like a jet
pack so I wanted to pay tribute to
curiosity I got to work on her for seven
years and at first I was thinking like
model rocket but without gyroscopes and
control algorithms things can get pretty
unsafe pretty quickly so I thought of
this idea where I use balloons that
could deflate and then they would
provide upward thrust like before
landing but... No
and as ridiculous as
this might seem it's actually not a
violation for most rules because you're
not touching it once you've released it
the fact is most competitions are using
rules that were written before you could
go on amazon and buy a toy drone for
less than 50 bucks
intact egg.
I save this one for last since
I've never seen anyone do it and it's
probably my favorite in terms of its simplicity
you want to buy fewer
balloons than you need and then just pop
them until you get to the point where
you're just under neutrally buoyant and
you can see at the bottom I've just got
this little protector of the egg you
don't have to get fancy but I use those
little animal balloons that it seems to
work pretty good this one weighs in at a
couple ounces so it is a strong option
if your competition favors lighter
contraptions
music
so which one is the best again it sort
of depends on the rules of your
competition in some cases being smallest
gets you the most points so I'm thinking
in airwolf all the way if being like
wait is the most important then go with
the helium up house method and if you're
egg just needs to survive then you can pick
any one of these but the most important
part is to have fun and experiment and
learn something and then to dominate
your competition
yeah you guys are good
no that's all right it's all right and
now you're on YouTube
Thanks for watching if you learn something or if
you didn't learn something or if you're
a mammal then you should subscribe :)

This is a mousetrap car.
They're common for competitions in high school physics classes
Just like the egg drop challenge or building toothpick bridges. The goal is to build a car that travels the furthest or goes the
Fastest, but in either case the only power provided to move the car is from a single
mousetrap. So today
I'm going to show you how to win first place by building some cars with the
World-record holder. Then we're gonna go to the West Coast Championships to see all these principles in action, and wait don't leave! I know that
99.7% of you have never, nor will ever make one of these,
but I will break down in simple terms
how I know this car will go twice as far as this one,
and then I'll prove it. And then we'll discuss why you see these
DVD wheels so often, but do they work? And why do some winning cars have wheels that look like this?
But before we fly all the way out the Texas to meet the world record holder,
I need to lay the foundation for the one overarching
fundamental physics principle behind the mousetrap car.
It's called mechanical advantage and to do that
I'm gonna need my niece and nephews. "Imma bet you guys I could lift my car off the ground
using just my pinkies. If I can't do it, you can have this crisp Benjamin
but if I can, you guys have to buy me ice cream. Deal?"
"I said nothing else but your Pinky!"
"I am using just my pinkies. "No just your pinkies." "That's what I'm doing!"
"This is really good you guys. Thank you."
If you're willing to move a greater distance.
You're able to reduce the amount of force and by a proportional amount.
I can't lift 500 pounds worth of car one time.
But I could lift 10 pounds 50 times. A mechanical advantage is the ratio of the output force over the input force.
So in this case it's 50. That means my hand had to travel 50 times further than just lifting the car in one shot.
But the weight was 50 times less, so it was totally worth it. This principle of mechanical advantage is everywhere.
Let's take a look at a few examples.
If I have 4 pulleys that means I have to pull the rope down 4 times further than the dumbbell goes up.
But in exchange, it feels four times lighter, so this has a mechanical advantage of 4. For the ramp
you look at the ratio of the length to the height. Your mechanical advantage therefore is 2.2. And that means
I have to travel a little further,
But the brick should feel 2.2 times lighter
pulling up the ramp versus just pulling the brick straight up. And sure enough if you measure each with a scale
This is exactly what you see. If you think about it a screw is just a ramp
wrapped around a nail. So here
you look at this has traveled around the thread and divided by the space in between the threads to get a mechanical advantage of 9
And as you know if you really want to multiply your force use a ratchet wrench
Now that is since your hand travels for one full rotation is 300 times longer
than the distance the screw moves vertically between one thread the total mechanical advantage is 300
It's like a really long short ramp
So if this scale reads 6 pounds the actual clamping force would be
300 times more or nearly a ton
And with wheels and axles it's the same story since this wheel diameter is twice what this one is as you could probably guess by
now this weight weighs twice as much so now we're balanced with a mechanical advantage of 2
And you'll also notice if I move this, the lesser weight travels twice as far and finally we have levers
Which is where we started with my niece and nephews, here if you compare the ratio of the distances from the pivot point we have
A mechanical advantage of 4 which of course means I have to move this end four times further
But it's super easy because it's 1/4 the weight on this side, and in all of these examples
Which you see everywhere around us you trade lower force for more distance travelled
This is how humans built amazing things before all these fancy machines with engines came around
Human muscles are totally strong enough as long as you're willing to spend a little more distance to do the task, and so this principle
Mechanical advantage is at play over and over again with the mousetrap cars only in reverse. It works both ways in other words
I don't want the full force of the spring acting over this tiny distance to act directly on the wheels or they would spin out
That would be a very inefficient
Transfer of energy from the spring, so we use
mechanical advantage and make the main lever arm 15 times longer than the spring lever arm, and then the wheel diameter is
24 times bigger than the wheel axle so then if we multiply them our total mechanical advantage is 1 over
360. That means the force is 360 times less right here on the output at the wheels to the floor
Versus right here on the input on the spring. It also means it will travel
360 times further than the distance this spring arm rotates
alright, so that's enough of a foundation for now let's go to Texas and meet up with my buddy Al, to build some racecars
Not only is he the mousetrap car world record holder,
but he also kind of started the whole thing, and
he was Texas high school physics teacher of the year, and since my dream job is to one day switch from working as an engineer
In the private sector, to go teach high school physics somewhere. I made him show me all his cool demos.
I came up with this idea back in
1991 and since that time I have literally built
thousands and thousands of mousetrap cars myself
I've seen every possible engineering design you could ever come up with
There's lots of different variations for rules for a mousetrap car race. Let's talk about how to build the best
Long-distance car first for our testing we started with three identical cars the only difference was the length of the lever arm
So one was short one was medium, and one was long, and I've calculated each of their mechanical advantages
Which you can see written here and given what we know about mechanical advantage. What do you think is about to happen?
As you might have guessed the short lever arm car takes a strong early lead this makes sense because it has the largest
mechanical advantage therefore the highest force
Where the wheels and ground meet the downside is that it's a short-lived burst and the medium and long lever arm cars pass it once?
It's quickly used up all its energy
In the end this is how far they each
traveled with the longest lever arm car going the
slowest
but making it all the way to 30 feet this brings up the first principle for the long distance car to win you want the
smallest possible force over the longest possible
Distance in other words the smallest fraction for mechanical advantage possible. You want your car to be barely creeping forward
To waste as little energy as possible
You could think of the total energy of the spring as this amount of water in this cup and then this cup represents
the amount of energy that's passed on to your car to move it forward if you just quickly dump it all the energy
a ton spills and splashes out this will be due to losses from extra heat generated or even drag force from the wind which is proportional
To your velocity squared, but if you do it slowly and more controlled much more energy
Goes to actually moving your car forward the next thing we tested was adding
Graphite to the axles on all three of the cars, and then we raced them
This made a huge difference and now they went this far
Again the longest lever arm car one because it was the slowest but this shows the importance of dealing with friction
It's definitely your biggest enemy with these cars and the friction comes from two spots
You have the rolling friction between the wheels and the ground and then the biggie is
between their axles and the car body
This is why we put the lubricating graphite powder there and to take our testing a step further
we took the long lever arm car and
Added ball bearings in place of the graphite and that set a new record for us at 50 feet so if you only have one
hour to make your car
And you want to have a good showing you can use a long lever arm like this in conjunction with the CD wheels
To give you a mechanical advantage of about one over
360 and then use ball bearings at the axles or just apply some graphite and you're gonna do pretty well
Next we figured if long lever arms make it travel slower and therefore further. We should do a super long lever arm
But it only made it to here which was worse than even the short lever arm car the problem was that it didn't Coast very
Well because we had to make it really big, which means it's more. Heavy, which means more friction
You know this already intuitively because it's harder to push a heavy object on a table than a light object because there's more friction
Resisting you so principle three is to make it lightweight
I love this example though because it shows you that you need to balance these principles if you take any one of them too far
Then another principle will creep in and start penalizing you. It's an optimization problem
And that's what makes the mousetrap racers such a great project
That's also why testing is so important so tweaking and testing different things like Allen
and I did is
critical for honing in on the sweet spot for your specific design next we tried this big wheel design which is a popular approach the
Strategy here is the wheel is
56 times larger than the wheel axle so when you combine it with the lever arm you get a built in mechanical advantage of one
Over 840 and that's the equivalent of a lever arm
That's two and a half feet long
But without needing the big heavy car. That seems like a good deal and as such it was our best car yet
And made it all the way to here. The downside is that it takes energy to get a big wheel like that
rotating it's called rotational inertia
Here's a demo I built to showcase his principle. These two wheels are
identical except this one has the steel weights placed at the outer edge of the wheel
Versus near the axle this means it has a higher
Rotational inertia so when we spin them both identically the one on the right starts spinning faster
And will reach a higher max speed, but the one on the Left will Coast for longer by having bigger
Heavy wheels you're basically using them as a temporary storage for your energy
And then you give it back during the coasting phase the problem with this is anytime you transfer energy
You lose some going back to the cups a little splashes out each time you pour it no matter
How slowly you do it?
So instead of pouring your spring energy into a big cup and then eventually getting it back in the coasting phase. It's better
Just to have reasonable size wheels and just have one slow pour directly near the final cup of making your car move
Additionally big wheels like this can be hard to steer so principle four is to reduce rotational inertia
This is also why you see people do this to their wheels sometimes
It's an effort to keep the wheels large in diameter to get that built-in mechanical advantage
But to make them wait less to reduce the energy given to rotational inertia
so the final test we ran was Al's world record car which travelled an
Astounding 600 feet when he set the record he did some crazy things like using jeweler's bearings on the axles
But the real secret is this pulley here in the middle if we look at the ratios and calculate the mechanical advantage from the lever
To the pulley to the wheels we're looking at one over four thousand six hundred and eight it's the equivalent of a 16-foot
Lever arm or back wheel four and a half feet in diameter
But without the downside of the extra weight or wasted rotational inertia
This thing barely crawls along it's hard to even see the spring lever arm moving as this back spins
It's really hard to beat a design like this
And now we'll quickly go through the speed car principle since most of the same principles apply the biggest difference is this time we want
To access all the energy from the spring in a short burst right at the beginning
Because the finish line is only 15 feet away
So it doesn't make sense to have a really small mechanical advantage like the pulley car
Here we want it much closer to the direct force of the spring itself
Which would be mechanical advantage of one, the problem is if we did that the wheels would slip so you basically want to incrementally
Increase your mechanical advantage by making your rear
axle thicker and thicker with tape until your rear wheels start to slip slipping is bad of course because that's waste of energy because your
Wheel is spinning without actually moving your car forward
It's helpful to zoom in and use the slow-mo on your phone to see if your wheels are slipping or not this means having good
Traction on your rear wheels is important because means you can have higher forces
Before you start to slip these squishy foam wheels work great
And just like with the distance car
Reducing friction by using bearings or graphite will definitely help as well making it lightweight because Newton's second law teaches us that heavier things are
Harder to accelerate just like you throw a baseball further
than a heavy bowling ball and
Smaller diameter wheels not only help by keeping your mechanical advantage closer to one but you don't have time to give energy to these big
Wheels and then get it back through coasting you want all that spring energy to go directly into making your car go forward
Okay, so those are the basic principles before we head to the west coast mousetrap car championships, I'll just mention
I put a list of 10 practical quick build tips in the video description for example
You should soak your bearings in
WD-40 to remove all the grease. The grease is useful if the bearings are actually seeing a lot of load
But since these cars weigh next to nothing
It's only gonna slow you down
I should also mentioned that my buddy Al has an amazing website called www.docfizzix.com or you can buy all the parts
I show today to experiment and come up with your own unique design. I also put that link below here we go
For this competition the objective was to travel forward 15 feet
And then returned back and stopped as close to the exact same spot you started in the least amount of time those moves may seem
Complicated but you can switch from forward to reverse
by simply switching the direction you wrap up your axle halfway through and you can stop at a certain point by using a wing nut
On a threaded axle so given the rules your design choices should foster both speed and precision about half the designs relied on
Preconceived notions and use CD wheels which are a real bad choice here because you're not looking for distance
They have more rotational inertia and poor traction
The winning team car which I won't show here because the finals are next month really focused on precision
They use ball bearings small foam wheels and they made their car body out of
Aluminum it weighs more than balsa wood, so it did cost more energy to friction
But there's plenty of energy in the spring for only traveling thirty feet
So it was worth the trade-off for the extra rigidity and repeatability they also told me they tested and tweaked their design for six months
It's just awesome to hang out and see all the various design approaches
Hopefully you learn enough by now to give you a solid foundation for your own unique design
So you can build, test, tweak like crazy, and then dominate the competition

I love science fairs because for a lot
of kids is their first exposure to
science and because of my background in
science and this YouTube channel and the
fact that I am an uncle I've consulted
on quite a few projects so today with
some help from my superstar nephew ty
we're not only going to tell you our
secrets on how to win we're gonna give
you 10 different science fair project
ideas most of which we've tried and not
to brag but they've won first place so
let's just get right started with the
ideas and then we'll tell you some of
our tips as we go along the first idea
is how many times do you need to shuffle
a deck of cards before they are
sufficiently mixed up so the idea is you
arrange all the cards in order and then
you have one person shuffle them and
then after each shuffle you count how
many cards are still in sequential order
so you repeat this a bunch of times and
then take an average of how many
shuffles it takes until you feel they're
sufficiently mixed up which I would
argue is really useful information to be
armed with and this brings us our first
really important power tip the project
should be relatable to the kid something
they encounter in their everyday lives
they actually want to test but like kids
can challenge something their parents
always tell them like this eating
carrots really give you enhanced night
vision whatever you do do not do the
science project what effect does
sunlight or no sunlight have on plant
growth
first of all three other people will
already be doing that project at your
science fair and secondly that is so
boring
what a lame first exposure to the
scientific method that would be a more
exciting idea it would be to test if the
five-second rule is really true so you
can op a piece of food on the ground and
leave it there for one second and then
drop another piece on the ground leave
it there for six seconds and then take a
culture of each and put it in a petri
dish and then compare the spore growth
after a couple days petri dishes are
like 15 bucks on Amazon and they're a
great way to measure the level of
bacteria on any surface so another
project idea would be to measure which
services in your house are the most
germ-infested okay for our fourth idea I
remember as a kid hearing that
professional soccer players would use
balls filled with helium and
that's why they were able to kick it so
far so you could test this by feeling
one ball with normal air and then one
with helium and then do a bunch of kicks
and see which one goes farther but
there's a slight problem with this and
it introduces our second power tip even
with the same ball I don't kick it the
same distance every single time so we're
introducing some extra uncertainty and
not just measuring the effect of the
helium so a better way to test this is
to drop them both from a tall distance
and see if one hits the ground later
than the other a good experiment is
designed such that you keep everything
the exact same and then you change only
one thing so in this example you drop it
from the same height ideally you'd have
the same model of ball and the only
thing that's different is one is filled
with helium and the other is filled with
air and then you measure one thing and
you see if there's a correlation so in
this case you're measuring how long
taste at the ground
so our second power tip is to come up
with an experiment where you keep
everything the same in between trials
except you change one thing and that'll
allow you to measure the effect of just
that one thing one of my nephew's won
first place in a science fair by testing
new video games really rot your brains
so you'd spend 30 minutes each day
either reading playing outside playing
with Legos or playing video games and
then you would take a short standardized
intelligence test after each session
this is a really cool concept but I feel
like there might be a lot of hidden
variables that would affect the tests so
like his mood whether or not he got a
good night's rest what do you eat that
day you really want to try and isolate
only the thing you're changing in
between trials but when quickly going
back to timing things if you want to
time something really accurately a
stopwatch isn't great because it depends
on your reaction time to hitting the
buttons a better way is to record the
event in slow-mo on your phone which
records at 240 frames per second and
then plays back at 30 frames per second
so you watch the video back in slow
motion and count how many seconds it
takes in slow-mo and then divide that by
eight and that's how many seconds it
took in real life that will give you
much more precise measurements on a
timed of it moving on the number
there's a paper written about the best
strategy for winning rock-paper-scissors
I'll put the link in the description
basically it boils down to what sign you
should throw depending on what your
opponent throughs around before so you
can first play a bunch of games before
you learn the rules and then you could
study the rules and then play a bunch of
games afterwards and see if your win
percentage increased going back to our
first power tip about making it
relatable you can see how that would be
way more exciting for a kid then the
number one result you get from Google
when you search for science fair project
ideas such as how to make your own pH
paper what are you even testing there
according to Tina Seelig who teaches
innovation and creativity and Stanford
sightseers are not only great
opportunity to learn science but also to
learn creativity when people asked her
how can you learn to be more creative in
a recent reddit AMA she said this
creativity is applying your imagination
to address a challenge this requires
both motivation and experimentation so
the best way to improve your creativity
is to tap into your motivation no matter
how small it is and begin experimenting
this can be as easy as seeing how you
feel after getting different amounts of
sleep or seeing how your colleagues
respond to you when you greet them in
different ways
these small experiments between up your
creative problem-solving abilities
notice she says here that the motivation
is just as important as the
experimentation and since learning have
you always win at rock-paper-scissors is
likely more motivating for a grade
schooler it will do much more for your
creativity than say learning how to make
pH paper I also really like that quote
because when I read it I hit
gotten data back from the woman who cuts
my hair about the tips she receives as a
favor to me and my curiosity for two
months she recorded not only how much
each person tipped her but she also
recorded their age gender cultural
background time and date of the week and
whether or not they were married she got
me data on over 230 haircut tips I will
leave a link to the spreadsheet in the
description if you're interested but one
of the more fascinating findings was
that Americans in general tipped almost
exactly 15% Europeans also tipped on
average 15% but there was a huge
variation so some tipped nothing and
then some tipped a bunch suggesting that
they're not super familiar with it
because tipping isn't really a thing
over there okay number six going back to
something your parents always telling
you there's practice really make perfect
so for this you choose a skill like
shooting free-throws and then practice
for a set amount of time every day and
then track your progress to see how
quickly you get better you do other
things too like cutting a golf ball or
mastering a song on an instrument or
even mastering a skill in like a video
game okay so for idea number seven what
is the best paper airplane design this
brings up our third power tip I'm posing
all of these ideas as questions but the
way the scientific method actually works
is you make some observations and then
based off those initial observations you
make a guess as to what you think will
happen
we call that gues hypothesis then you
perform a bunch of tests to basically
try and prove your guess wrong and if
you can't prove it wrong no matter how
hard you try then it must be true and we
accept it is true so for the paper
airplanes maybe your hypothesis would be
that airplanes with really narrow wings
fly further than those with wide wing
spans to create a bunch of variations
and basically try and prove that guessed
wrong just make sure you do it indoors
going back to power tip to making sure
there aren't external influences outside
of your control that would affect the
experiment like the wind idea eight is
what
the best way to heat up food in your
microwave so you can one food like a
frozen burrito and then test a bunch of
different settings and maybe locations
in your microwave to check the
temperature you can use an infrared
microwave like I invented for a previous
video but feeling that a meat
thermometer should be just fine
you can also use a thin layer cheese to
develop a hot spot map for microwave by
seeing which areas melt first and
incidentally if you measured the
distance between melted spots in
conjunction with the frequency of your
microwave you can actually calculate the
speed of light I'll put the link below
in the video description if you'd like
more details on how to do that whatever
you do and this brings up our final
power tip make sure you can explain it
in your own words
most science figures have an interview
portion where the judges come around and
talk to each of the students they do
this because it's a way to tell if the
parent did all the work if the kid can't
explain it well this is another reason
why picking the relatable project
matters it's easier to explain how you
dominate your friends and
rock-paper-scissors and it is to get
pumped about a slightly withered plant
in the shade we recommend practicing the
interview in front of the poster the
night before by having a grown-up ask
some mock the interview questions for
idea 9 I made a video to test which
animal people would swerve more to hit
on the side of the road so I use a
rubber tarantula snake and turtle now I
don't recommend you repeat this but you
can do a slightly safer version by
taking these animals and hiding them on
a sidewalk and then secretly watching to
gauge people's reactions the only
problem with this is the thing you're
measuring is the person's reaction which
is sort of hard to quantify you really
want to pick things to measure that have
numbers associated with them that you
can easily record so like time or
distance or number winds or spores in a
petri dish etc and for the final idea
you know how people are always looking
at babies and they tell the parents like
oh my gosh she looks just like you I
think that's bull as far as I can tell
babies just look like babies they're all
the same the other day at work someone
saw a picture of my co-workers baby and
send this so I decided to call him on
and I got a picture of my coworker and
his wife and then like ten random babies
and I passed it out to see if people
could guess so you could use with
picture view and some other random
babies and then your parents and then
give them to people and see people to
pick out which one is here and by the
way exactly zero people were able to
guess which one his kid was so people
are liars
so those are my ten idea is if you have
a really good idea that you want a first
place so they've put in the comments
below and then I'll take the best ideas
and just make a growing killer list of
ideas in the video description and maybe
you don't have a science fair coming up
but perhaps you can share this with
someone who does and then we can replace
the really lame ideas that currently
come up in Google search results for
those who are just getting started with
science regardless if you use one of
these ideas or even better come up with
your own based upon the principles we
talked about most important part is that
you have fun you experiment you learn
something and then you dominate your
competition so I am here today with
Jason whom you know well from the most
popular sketch comedy channel on YouTube
Studio C and he's actually here because
we filmed the video together on their
channel okay Jason so why don't you tell
us about the script you wrote alright so
the basic premise is there's a group of
plane crash survivors on a deserted
island and they discover mark is in
their company and at first they think of
this is great right like mister
invention man himself it's gonna come up
with all these coconut devices that'll
make their lives you know happy and
carefree
well the inventions don't go with acne
as they first saw them perhaps as Mark
and his twisted mind it's not my fault
you guys have enough video we didn't
appreciate at the time and maybe you
know in ten years we can laugh and you
get to see mark in his first major
acting debut yes worth first that maybe
laughs once you see it so you be the
judge I'm gonna put a link right here
make sure you subscribe to studio C they
have really funny stuff that's always
clean and just really high quality so
check it out and as always thanks for
watching
you
a few weeks ago
I lost my wallet which made me sad because it is a pain to get everything replaced
Then I thought, what kind of person doesn't return a wallet
And then I thought I'm a firm believer in the scientific method,
I should test some hypothoses.
So I got 200 identical wallets in order to drop them in each of the 20 cities you see here the goal being not
Only to see which cities were the most and least honest, but to ask
questions of anyone who called in to see if I could pick out some patterns among the honest ones and I wanted to make the
Wallets look as real as possible so in each of them
I put a fake ID with no picture so as not to bias people six American dollars and 200 Filipino dollars
This is a way to make it look like a lot of money when in reality this is only worth 4 bucks
Then I put in an ultrasound picture and on the back we hand wrote a date from four years ago
And then this adorable picture of a puppy I found on reddit. The goal was in addition to the ID and the money I wanted
To make a look like the wallet had sentimental value to the owner.
I was trying to remove any excuse for someone not to return the wallet such as it looked fake
Or it wouldn't be worth hassle
If there was only 2 bucks inside of a blank wallet. So in our case if they didn't return it
It would only be because they weren't being honest. Then we had a fake loyalty card and a random business card
And then critically a card that looked like he came with the wallet
That said if found please call and then we wrote the phone number.
And then because it's impractical for me to actually visit 20 cities
I went on the Instagram page from a YouTube channel to ask for help and right away the response was awesome. Once I'd selected my
20 helpers I sent them instructions and shipped them each 10 wallets and then last Monday all across, North America
operation wallet drop commenced.
(music)
I asked them after they dropped the wallets to try and get some secret footage if
Possible and to do that they came up with some pretty clever methods.
I'm actually gonna tuck the wallet underneath my car so I Drive away it stays in the parking lot
Almost immediately calls started pouring in from all of the cities so when people call in we ask them eight
Questions such as if they were religious or not or if there was still money in the wallet when they found it and if so
Of course we told them just keep it. So after three days of collecting data:
Here's what we found for starters and this blew my mind two-thirds of the wallets were returned and of those that were returned
96 percent still had the money inside. The average age of one of the caller's was
36 which is almost exactly the average age of a person in the U.S.
So how old you are it doesn't seem to affect honesty.
There's a pretty big disparity in which cities were the most and least honest
and I'll get to the rankings in just a minute.
But first I wanted to test a
hypothesis that a person without a lot of money in considered poor would be less likely to return the wallet than someone who had a
lot of money. And to do this I looked at publicly available census data and found the zip codes with the highest and lowest
medium income then I instructed my friends helping in each city to randomly drop half the wallets in the high-income area of the city and
then the other half in the low-income area. In each while it was marked with a unique number on the back of this card
so we knew exactly which city and location if somebody called it in. And when we tallied it up:
60 wallets were called in from the high-income areas and
exactly 60 wallets were also returned from the low-income areas which I thought was pretty cool. So a rich person is no more likely to return
A wallet than someone in the lowest income bracket who could probably use the money.
In fact: we had one person calling who is homeless, two people calling who are living in shelters, and a fourth person who is a
panhandler. All four of them had full wallets. Another question
I wanted a test was if women were more honest than men it turns out a majority of the wallets were returned by men but
Think about it that doesn't necessarily mean. They are more honest because maybe the locations they were dropped
There's typically more men like in front of a sports bar or a hardware store so to control for this
I had all my helping friends in each city dropped two of the ten wallets in a men's restroom
And then two in a women's bathroom
This way we could control the gender of the wallet finder once again this came up nearly identical
with 23 wallets returned for men versus
24 for women so gender doesn't seem to play a role in a person's honesty either
And I should mention here one of the questions
We asked the caller's was if they thought the wallet looked fake
or
Suspicious at all and only a very small minority did so this confirms that for those who didn't call it was likely because they were
Dishonest and not because they thought it wasn't a real person's wallet another thing we tested was small town versus big city
So you notice four of the cities you've probably never heard of before that's because they have populations of around a thousand people
whereas the rest were the largest cities in North America and here we did see a
Significant difference in the small towns the average rate of return was eight wallets whereas in the big cities
It was six
And I think this sort of makes sense to me because small towns tend to foster a sense of community
Where everyone knows everyone versus the anonymity of a big city and now for a rundown of all the cities?
I'll break them into three categories starting with the least honest
We've got Detroit with three wallets returned and New York City with four I was really rooting for Detroit and hoping they would just surprise
Everyone but looks like maybe they're still in the process of their rebuilding efforts then for the middle of the pack at five wallets return
We've got Seattle, Los Angeles Miami Dallas and Edmonton and at six well. It's return
We've got Huntsville, Alabama and New London Connecticut, which is one of our small towns next at seven wallets
We've got San Francisco, Winnipeg and Washington DC
The final category is the Honest Abe cities with Parma, Idaho and Las Vegas at eight wallets
And I should mention for Vegas instead of high-income and low-income we put half on the strip and then half in the suburbs and for
What it's worth all five dropped on the strip were returned and then at a remarkable nine wallets return
We've got two more small cities with Nashua, Idaho and Hill City, South Dakota and then Portland
Oregon Macon Fred and Carrie proud and finally there were two cities with an astounding
100% return rate vote for big cities with Chicago which I didn't see coming
And then Salt Lake City and before he just shot, Salt Lake City up to those gosh darn super nice Mormons
It's like of the eight people wearable the interview only three said they were religious and only one
Attended church in fact about 40% of the people who turn in wallet said they were not religious
And this is close enough to the average for a large city that
it's fair to say that whether or not a person was religious seem to have no outcome on their honesty according to our data and
I should also mention that while our two Canadian cities finished right in the middle of the pack my Canadian friend saw this on his
Facebook page right after dropping his wallets and going the extra mile with a
Blanket Facebook post to find a random wallet owner is just about the most Canadian thing ever
He also dropped ten wallets in Disneyland, and we were hoping to get a large number back
But we only got four calls from individuals
and then too from
Security who were super confused when they had identical wallets turned in at which point they made it very clear
They would not be calling us back if more wallets came in because they hate science so we had a third Disney Line now as
A data point because we just don't know how many got turned into security
So those were the findings
And I'd say from all this I learned two things
The first is that it's a really good idea to put your phone number somewhere in your wall
That's probably one of the reasons we have such a high rate of return also
I found out if you find a wallet you can drop it in any u.s.
Post office box, and then we return it to the address found on the driver's license free of charge
I tested this out and it totally works and the second thing is that in general
People are way more honest than I originally thought having just lost my wallet
I was anticipating a return rate of maybe 20%
so to get two out of every three wallets back blew my mind in one city a
Convenience order loved what we were doing so she kept putting the wallet back in the bathroom received someone would steal it and after six
Times of somebody bringing the wallet back with all of the money inside she gave up trying
Lately it seems like so much of what you see online is meant to stoke
Outrage at some group of people versus ourselves because that's what gets shared and that begins to warp our
Perspectives that the only good people out there are those within our own group
but this cold hard data shows that across any age or gender or
socio-economic background
cross the whole religious spectrum through middle of
America and along the coast there are lots of good people everywhere and not only that but they constitute a majority
these people didn't call it for some reward or
Facebook lights or because they knew someone was watching they did it because it was simply the right thing to do and I think that's
Pretty cool and something worth remembering

so a couple of years ago I uploaded my
halloween costume to youtube where I use
two iPads to blow a hole through my
stomach so the internet seemed to like
it and that was a cool feeling so I
decided that every year I'd try and come
up with just awesome innovative costumes
because I felt like most of the options
out there kind of looked like this ah so
this year we've got 24 new costume ideas
that we've been working on all year that
we are really excited to show you guys
[Music]
so first of all we perfected the digital
Halloween shirt that I invented last
year
so you still download the free app
called digital duds then you blow Kate
and play your animation but now after 40
prototypes we've engineered a design
that can hold any sized mobile device
including an iPhone 6 plus so you just
slide it right in front and then it will
hold it secure in place and then when
you want to take it out it takes less
than two seconds and you're wearing a
normal t-shirt so that means you show up
the party and blow people's minds it
just jeans and a t-shirt but on a
moment's notice you are gonna be able to
nail that selfie so we've got some new
really cool Halloween designs or you
could go this route Plus this year we
got permission from Marvel to make some
shirts like them
[Music]
but we took it a step beyond t-shirts
this year and created some really
awesome and not at all creepy masks like
this so again you just locate and then
play the animation and then slide your
mobile device right in and then you are
instantly the most epic undead guy at
the party so we also created this
pulsing brains on me
a clown with an oral hygiene problem a
cyclops with an attitude and one of my
personal favorites the cyborg and for
anyone with the fear of drowning we have
this option but I also teamed up with
the guys for more costumes again and we
made what we're calling no real morph
suits which is basically like putting on
someone else's skin in less than 15
seconds my buddy Trey tried this one on
at which point he was basically
streaking fully clothed
and finally we teamed up with YouTube
prank video genius magic of her ha to
create a series of four prank illusion
costumes like the severed hand I showed
earlier and while we think this is
pretty awesome we're all about testing
and collecting data so we're hop took
this out into public to see what other
people thought so another costume that
we created with excuse me is what we
call
so here's some footage we made this
costume where you can basically walk up
to the party in two pieces and finding
we have this jacket which doesn't really
look that special and until you sneeze
so this year keep it simple show up for
the party in jeans in the t-shirt or do
any one of these awesome costume ideas
which means you won't have to show up as
last-minute generic costume guy so to
get any of these costumes plus a couple
more I didn't show you you can click
here at more suits calm or just use the
link in the description as always I hope
you guys have an amazing and a safe
Halloween now go down the native party
Oh unite give me kisses
A while back I was eating lunch with
some co-workers and we were debating
about just how far you would sink if you
jumped into a pool of these orbeez
For example would it go up to your calf
or to like your waist or all the way
above your head
Everyone seemed to have
a different theory, in fact I asked about
a hundred people and you can see how
much the guess is varied, so as a firm
believer in the scientific method I
decided to test our hypotheses
So I'm here today in the backyard of the
backyard scientist. so for the past six
months we've been stockpiling these
orbeez in Kevin's backyard and
today it's finally the moment of truth
all right you ready for this let's do it
so take a moment to guess in the
comments below of how far you think we'll
sink and then we'll see if you're right
For the record I think I will sink to about
the waist, okay here we go
This Feels so crazy
This feels like its compressed on all sides but
it's so smooth and like slippery
So it looks like I was wrong by quite a bit
and we have to reject the null hypothesis
So now what
I decided to call
up my nephews you guys want to come
swimming at my friend's house in my
ongoing quest to be the favorite uncle
only I might have forgotten to tell them
there'd be no water in the pool
also that kevin was right there
You guys ready to go swimming in this
But before we go swimming in 25 million orbeez let's talk about why I was wrong
It has to do with buoyancy so here's a riddle when
this ice melts will the water level go
up or down as you can see here it
actually doesn't change at all
Archimedes taught us that you displace
your weight in water
so this baseball weighs about 135 grams
and when I put it in water it will sink
until it is pushed out 135 grams worth
of water at which point it's in
equilibrium and it floats and since the
waterline is about halfway up the
baseball you know it's about half as
dense as water and this is why
scooby-doo quicksand is pure lies you
sink until you've displaced your weight
in quicksand and since it's about twice
as dense as a person you Bob like a cork
about halfway down and it's impossible
to sink so Atreyu
relax your horse is going to float
So I
will keep sinking in Orbeez until I have
displaced my weight in Orbeez and since
they're a little more dense than me and
taking account the packing efficiency of
a sphere surrounded by water the fact
that about 85 percent of me sank makes
sense
I thought the friction between the balls
would play a bigger role which is why I
guessed halfway so I was wrong but a lot
of times that's more fun because that
means the result was unexpected and you
learn something okay back to the pool
Guess where my foot is
So a huge thanks to Kevin for letting us
use his pool he actually also made a
video we did eight crazy experiments
with a pool full of water balls so go
check that out because his footage is
amazing as always I also want to thank
Squarespace for helping to make this
video possible
you guys know I've been using them to
build websites long before they offered
to sponsor my videos it's really easy
there's no coding required and you get a
highly customized website that's super
professional my infrared microwave
website took me about an hour to put
together so if you have an idea you want
to launch or maybe you just want to
showcase your business or perhaps a
hobby go to Squarespace.com/markrober for a free trial and then when
you're ready use offer code MARKROBER
for 10% off so everybody wins because
not only will you have a super
customizable website that looks amazing
but you'll be supporting future videos
that I have in the works thanks for watching

I can wait
so this is an idea I've had for over a
year now where you could display some
cool artwork to potentially tens of
thousands people in one night for really
cheap
like it super cool
so I made a Mario Knight kite but
obviously there's a ton of possibilities
here ie note here the blinking white LED
so it's sparkle Google Maps links are so
2011 you split this sucker 500 feet
above your house secure the arrow to the
string that's takedown in your backyard
it's matter which way the wind blows and
always points right at your house this
is for all you Red Sox fans this is
great because even if someone outside
the stadium wants to take it down it's
really hard to find the string that's
staked into the ground to do so you do
something really cool for like a 4th of
July festival or jeah that independencia
or like Boxing Day there's something
which is a cool concept because your
artwork if you see by potentially tens
of thousands people all night long for
around a hundred bucks or so especially
when you consider those lanes skywriting
planes and for about 10 grand you get
approximately this amount of Awesome
oh and keep it up for the 500 because
they will shut you down hard okay I was
going officer and if you want to see how
I made the Mario Knight kite or if you
want the links to where I got all this
stuff for really cheap then check out
this how-to video if you want to see
more creative junk like how to lure
guerrilla with an iPhone 4 if you want
to see my 2012 Halloween costume which
is honestly better than the one from
last year then you best be subscribing
so this is my pinewood derby car for
this year I was disqualified because
apparently using jet propulsion goes
against the spirit of the competition
the years I made it so I just bored a
hole in the car just large enough and
then I placed a co2 cartridge in the
hole there actually is no step - nothing
else about the cars performance really
matters as long as you've done step one
the firing mechanism is just an electric
stable gun I've loaded with brass like
little nails so it could puncture the
top of the co2 cartridge and then I took
tape of paint starting to stick to the
bottom so it will trigger the safety
switch and the hole also helps to retain
the cartridge before firing
so if you forearm on an angle like this
part of the force vector will propel the
car forward the other part will serve to
keep it on the track and that theory
works approximately 40% of the time you
want to see how I use science to make a
pilot dirty car in 45 minutes that won
all the races by at least two car
lengths and is actually legal and click

Choose that one Facebook friend you don't really know that well.
Then go back like five years on their timeline and like just a random, insignificant post.
It's subtle, but once they get the notification, they'll assume
you look at all their posts for the past five years, and they'll be sufficiently creeped out
and you'll have one less faithful friend. You really didn't like the first place. Mint toothpaste oreos!
Awesome. This one is great for a college dorm. You just go to the pet store and get like a ton of feed crickets because
They're like 10 cents apiece, and you walk down the other guy's hall at like 3 a.m.
and you just drop them as you walk along the crickets will crawl under the doors into the dark rooms to escape the bright hall light for
like weeks
They'll be kept up at night because as soon as you try to locate the chirping, it stops. Don't do this one because being destructive
Is never cool.
But I just want to make the observation that it somehow seems a lot less appealing either upscale black Angus Steakhouse if
the G burns out
Last one is great because you can get so many people on it simply-
Sorry about that. Simply flash up a fake related videos image already start talking again. Everyone will be like
Whaaaaaaaaaaat? OK, This time it's for reals.
Hey Guys! So for this month's video, I was chillin' in my office at work with these cool Mario Wall Stickers and I just felt
like something
was kind of missing. So I thought of an idea and I made this. And by I made this what I mean is I called
up my buddy Chad who's a lot smarter than me and he made this.
(Music)
(Voiceover) So from the outside it's just a normal Nintendo with a clock on it. So right now it's 7:09, but on the inside,
you've got a battery pack, you've got a speaker right here then you have an Arduino board which is the brains the whole thing. The motion
sensor here that comes out the side
and then the front you have the display and of course, all this is actually controlled by the buttons on the
Nintendo
So the point is, you put this by your door and then when a co-worker comes in, it plays the Tube Sound it's like They're
entering this Mario World. And then the song plays while they're in your office, and then when they leave again the Tube sound plays and it
just goes back to a normal clock. And the best part is,, they have 400 Mario seconds to say what they want to say,
and then get the heck out of your office.
Oh, and the song that's played is just whatever's in The root directory on the SD Card that you put into the Arduino board,
so you could totally mix it up depending on which game that you actually want to emulate.
So is this Completely wasteful and ridiculous? Yes. But hear me out on this.
(Co-worker enters room)
(Co-worker) It's the middle of the night, right? I'm dreaming. I'm like, I've gotta be a deep REM or whatever it's called. RED.
Cuz you know that Jennifer, has it she's got the
Goiter,
Mole,  I'm like Oh,
Yeah! And then, oh, all of a sudden she like starts, "Hey!", and the Goiter Is all like there, and God
Just, oh Gosh
(Co-worker leaves)
(Voiceover) You can even use it at home!
*Romantic saxophone music starts*
(Mark's Wife) Are you serious!?
(Voiceover) Just, don't forget you changed the song.
(Another Co-worker) Hey, I got the report-
*Romantic saxophone music starts again*
(Mark) NO NO NO NO
We have  all the codes he wrote to program the Arduino boards and pretty much anything else you need to know to build one of
these yourself and the link is in the video description and of course, it's free
cuz he's just a cool guy like that. And
also, my buddy Lincoln has a channel so you should go check it out and sub because their stuff is really, really funny
That's all I got!
as you guys know I like to post videos
of things that I think are cool that you
can't find anywhere else on YouTube so
today I'm going to tell you how to flip
a coin and get tails every time so it's
actually a couple different ways to do
this one of which involves you flip the
coin and then when you catch in your
hand you quickly feel for the smooth
side which means down side is heads
which means you quickly roll it in your
hand if you want to get heads or just
slap it down if you want to get tails
and I actually did find YouTube video
about how to do that but I think that
mint is kind of lame for two reasons one
who actually floats a hoarder like this
I'm doing a clayey that's a tails and
two with these new quarters it's
actually kind of harder to feel which is
head which is tails
so the method I'm going to show you were
for a coin smooth not doesn't matter and
somebody else could he could catch it
so I actually figured this out one day
college I remember I was walking to
class and I got it
so poem I have five this random couple
walking by and then I made them stand
there and watch me flip ten tails and
row I guess first let's talk about the
actual physics behind flipping a quarter
when you flip a coin they're really two
motions so you have your arm your arm
motion that comes up and that's really
what makes the quarters come up and go
down the second motion is flicking your
thumb on the edge of the quarter like
this and that's what gives the quarter
the end-over-end motion that's supposed
to ensure that has an equal probability
of landing either on the heads or the
tail side so for this trick flip I'm
going to show you we're not going to
change the first motion your arm still
comes up like this well for the SAC
camera motion instead of flipping the
coin end-over-end like this what you
actually do is you turn your hand about
45 degrees and you flick it off-center
so again the first motion still sends
the quarter straight up and down but the
rotation
the coin is such that it's more of a
wobble and so the tail sight for example
is always facing up so it looks like
it's a fair flip but in actuality tail
is always not heads is always down which
is kind of trick right so that way we
catch it tails is obviously going to be
up to seriously about five minutes of
practice you have this down pretty good
so from personal experience this is very
useful like if you're hanging out with
friends you're trying to figure out what
to do naturally your idea is going to be
better than theirs but you don't have to
come out and like say it so you just do
the pair thing and you flip forward in
fact just last week I was hanging out
with a friend and I set up some cameras
just to capture how awesome this trick
is and granted the friend I trick he's a
little bit slow but I swear this even
works on your smart phones roll it oh
okay epic war comes down to this the
spoils of war all right dad I owned you
I'm starving
cook it some beat that's fine to talk
about ah dude let's do Wiener schnitzel
dude this is just terrible I vote we
flip for now we are fair funny where my
little little work that's fine all right
so tails tugger bone heads wiener
central all right got it wait what about
what I want okay sweetie
if its tail's we go to Taco Bell it's
heads
Wiener schnitzel anything else
you Pig oh we can pay for it
nice one dog
you
I just want to say thanks to everyone
who subscribe to the channel it makes it
a lot more fun to do things like this
and you know there's other people out
there I think that it's cool I know a
lot of you actually came over for mr.
Archer Trejo's Channel
he gave me a nice shout out but for the
five or six that I earn on my own fair
and square
you got to totally go over check out his
channel I've actually known him and his
wife Nancy for about fourteen years
they're both really funny and their
channel is a real hoot real hoot can say
hoot and between you and me most people
actually just watch his channel to see
his wife Nancy in San Jose Louise so
just kind of fast forward it on Arturo's
talking like I do you're gonna love it
anyways thanks for the love I've got
another video to post in the next two
weeks I think you guys are really like
and then four or five beyond that kind
of in the works and of course a
Halloween costume idea for next year
just gonna make this year's costume look
like this so just subscribe and you
won't have to look like this just me you
guys have conversations efficient I'm
starving mother is way harder than the
Wizard anything else oh okay a missile
I designed this machine to win the jackpot
everytime on our kid games like these where you have to hit the button at the exact moment the light comes by
So the plan was for me to be a hero amongst my buddies and a veritable Chuckie Cheese Robin Hood giving out free tickets to all
The little kids, but that's not
What actually happened
it actually turned out way more interesting and the more I tested the more
I realized this was turning into a repeat of when I use physics to expose the rigged carnival games because by building this super precise
Little robot I discovered arcade games like this are pretending to be one thing when in fact
They're total scams. now in order to explain just how bad they're scamming you let me first explain how my machine works and then walk
through the results of our testing for the past two months
Fundamentally the way this works is you have a photoresistor right here
And it senses the light five or six lights
Upstream of where you need to hit the button to get a jackpot and then after a pre-programmed delay the plunger comes down and hits
The button. To build this my buddy John
And I started by designing the main base in CAD and then we 3D printed it overnight
And then we attached the photoresistor at the end of the articulating arm
And then we took a solenoid with a plunger and attached it to the base
It's powered by 20 volts worth of double-A batteries
And this is the same power pack I use to trigger the Super Soaker and the brains of the operation
Is this wireless Arduino board and it connects via Wi-Fi to a
Super ghetto app that we made an app is critical because it lets you adjust the delay between
Sensing the light and pushing the plunger so if you miss short
You just add a few milliseconds to the delay and try again
And then to disguise the whole thing we put it in a backpack and cut a hole in the bottom so the plunger could access
the big button on the machine
So to set it up. You simply walk in set the backpack down and then pull out your phone like you're checking dankmemes
as you can see the disguise worked really well
And no one ever suspected anything. so at this point. We were ready for our first real-world test and the results were disappointing
We were getting jackpots, but only about every 30 tries, and what was so frustrating is we got the timing dialed in so well
we would miss short by one light and then not adjust the timing at all and then the very next run we
This long by one light. So for 30 attempts without changing anything about half were missing one light short and the other half were missing
One light long so this could mean only one of two things, either we had some errors in our machine
that was introducing some variability or there was something shady going on with the game itself
And troubleshooting because things don't go as planned is
incredibly common with doing any engineering task so to fix it you have to
Systematically do some detective work to figure out where the error is coming from. In the last interview Carl Sagan ever gave
He said science is more than a body of knowledge
It's a way of thinking
so here was our thought process and if I can prove that my
Machine was super precise then the only reason we weren't getting a jackpot would be because the game was rigged so I needed to start
By looking at any potential sources of variability error in my machine there were only three
so it could be the
Photoresistor the solenoid or the arduino. There was one
External source we considered and that was light pollution from all the flashing lights in the arcade could mean the input to the light sensor
Was too noisy and therefore not repeatable now
There's a trick when it comes to troubleshooting where you test several?
Potential error sources at the same time, and if I can get really precise results within this loop
Then I know that none of those components are the source of the error without having to take time to test each individually
so to test all three of these at once we made a simple app that flashed a white screen and started a stopwatch at the
Exact same time and then we set the trigger for exactly one second later and sure enough we were getting results with one millisecond precision
We also repeated the test with an incandescent bulb just like the game and got the same super accurate results
Now to appreciate that one millisecond of precision one flap of a hummingbird wing takes 12
Milliseconds so one millisecond is literally this long if you pull out your phone and trying it the stopwatch to land on four point
Zero zero seconds that's really hard
And this is just a two decimal places
I had some friends of mine use a timer app that went out to three decimal places which is milliseconds
and then I
Challenged them to land exactly on four seconds and in one hundred tries these mere humans with their pitiful non machine reaction times
Were only able to do it once whereas my robot can do it pretty much every time
So there's definitely no error coming from the hardware components
But maybe the sensor is being told to trip at different times because there's so many additional
Flashing lights in an arcade and to investigate that we looked at the signal data from the sensor
Which looked really noisy
And low like this
until you see a spike in
Intensity every time the light would come around which is when the delay countdown would start because we have such a narrow field of view
On the sensor when we compared the time between each of the peaks it was also precise down to the millisecond so light pollution
Wasn't the issue either
With this in mind I headed to a different arcade with some family friends and their kids to see if things would be any different
And we did win a few jackpots
But for the most part once again
We would alternate missing by one light on either side of the jackpot without making any
Adjustments to my machine which as a reminder can repeatedly hit the same mark within
1/12 of a hummingbird wing flap and so at this point it was pretty clear that these games just randomly hand out rare jackpots
but just to be sure I did some digging and was able to locate a 25 year old manual for the cyclone arcade game and
Sure enough if you flipped all the way to the back to page 31 it states the machine owner can specify
How often they want a jackpot to be won
Which actually makes sense because in our testing a lot of times
We'd hit a jackpot right away, and then go through a dry spell until we would finally get a jackpot again on average
Maybe 30 games later and so in conclusion
My issue here isn't that this arcade game makes money for the arcade owner
My issue is this arcade game presents itself as a winnable game of skill when in reality
It's a random dice roll
That is heavily stacked against you
And if you recall from the carnival scam video the most lucrative games for the carnival owner are those where people overestimate
their chances of winning that is
Exactly what happens in this game
especially when you might play a few games
And get it to stop one light short or one light long thinking
You are so close to getting a jackpot when in reality you weren't close at all in gambling psychology
this is known as the near miss effect and people will spend much more money to try and win because they think they can just
Do it on the next one and for that reason it should come as no surprise
That this scam machine is considered the highest earning redemption arcade game ever made so if I were you
I'd save your tokens for skee-ball
There's a plunger in the backpack and then it pushes down on the thing is that cool
So you're basically cheating?
Well I mean cheating is a strong word I'm using an advantage I might have created myself
It's a new year
Which means it's time to make new goals and one of my new goals for this year
is learning how to make really cool motion graphics animations like the guys from the YouTube channel Kurzgesagt

I suck at darts, but I'm good at engineering which means...
I'm actually really good at darts.
Most of the projects I've built for my YouTube channel
take a month or two to pull off,
But I've been working on this beast
with my former NASA co-worker John for over 3 freaking years.
And here she finally is.
So it's fairly self-explanatory, but you throw a dart,
and as long as your initial throw is somewhere within this diameter or so,
the dart board helps out a little bit.
And what's cool, is if you use this dart,
it will make you the worlds best dart player,
because you get a bullseye nearly every time,
and even if you don't it's really close.
But if you use this dart,
it makes you the worlds worst dart player
because it calculates the initial trajectory,
and then moves the board in the exact opposite direction.
So eventually we took this thing to a bar
to see if it would work in the wild
but before we get to that, let's talk about how it actually works.
Fundamentally, there are two main parts to this system.
First, you need to somehow predict where a dart is going to land,
with a typical throw from regulation distance,
and you have about 200 milliseconds to do that.
And then second, you need to somehow move the board
to that predicted location,
and you have about another 200 milliseconds to do that.
So let's start with the first part, about how we predict where the dart is going to land.
So the real secret here is that our dart has these tiny retroreflectors on it,
And then we have a VICON motion capture system.
As humans, we can see in 3D because we have 2 eyes,
And our brain calculates the difference between the two images,
and then tells us how far or close things are.
This is why if you close one eye,
you instantly lose that depth perception.
So that's basically what we're doing here,
Except we have 6 "eyes" all around the room,
And each of these "eyes" or cameras can take a 4K resolution picture,
260 times per second.
But since it's hard to visually separate something so small,
moving so fast in front of a busy background,
they actually use IR.
So they blast out IR from all these IR LEDs
and then it hits the retroreflectors, and then bounces back to the lens.
So when I wave the dart around like this,
this is what you and I see,
but the motion capture system just sees a solitary dart, floating around.
One of the reasons this board took us so long to build
was that for the first 2 years, we were trying to make our own motion capture systems,
so we had our own cameras,
and one of these awesome NVIDIA TX1 boards which is basically like a Raspberry Pi,
on Russian steroids.
But it turns out, it's a super complex problem to solve, and the VICON system was just turn key.
So now that we have the XYZ position of the dart as it travels through the air,
we used some MATLAB code to then predict, where it will land.
And the trick here is that anything you throw into the air (neglecting air resistance),
will travel in a perfect parabola.
Even something you wouldn't think of like a high jumper.
If you track their center of mass, it actually follows a perfect parabola shape.
So we used our understanding of parabolas, and from a side view,
we used that to predict the final up and down position of the board.
And then to predict the final left right position of the board, we know from a bottom view
a dart will follow a linear path.
So we used good old y = mx + b, and the y intercept
or b in this case, tells you how to move it left and right for the final position.
So now that we know where to move, let's talk about how we actually do it.
So the board itself is on two linear sliders which allows it to translate to any specific location.
So that provides the track on where to move, but the engine would be these 6 stepper motors
you can see from the front.
Each motor has a spool and then some fishing line, and they all attach to the center of the back of the board right here.
Once we have the predicted bullseye spot, the computer does the trigonometry,
and then sends the commands over here to the motors.
So to move to the left, it would say like "you need to spin up, but you need to unspin at the same rate".
Now you can see in the back the computer signal comes into this Arduino compatible board here,
and then you got some preamps here that bump up the voltage signal
to the 6 individual stepper motor controllers,
and these stepper motor drivers take the moving instructions,
and combine it with the power from the plug in the wall,
after it goes through this AC/DC power converter
and then finally a bunch of voltage pulses from the motor controller cause the motor to take small steps and either wind up, or wind down.
Now keep in mind, all of this happens in less than half a second,
and allows us to hit our sub millimeter precision in our board positioning.
And we don't just make one guess on the final position of the board,
we update and refine that guess anywhere from 10 to 100 times,
which is why sometimes you sort of see the board jitter into the final position.
So we took it to a bar to see what people thought.
In general we found if you're really drunk, you get so pumped at your new abilities,
if not slightly confused.
*I used to suck at darts!*
When I get an idea like this, I can't not do it
even if it takes me 3 years, and is a terrible financial decision.
So I want to give a huge thanks to the cool people at DollarShaveClub.com
I don't really feel that comfortable with the whole Patreon thing,
so if you think this is cool and you want to see more stuff like it in the future, you should go check them out.
I've been a fan of what they do, from the beginning,
and not only does it save you time and money,
but I personally prefer their razors over the overpriced monopolized options you find at the store.
So if you go to DollarShaveClub.com/MarkRober or use the link in the description,
It's $1 with free shipping for the first month, and a couple bucks a month after that.
And as you would expect from cool people, there's no hidden fees, no commitments,
and you can cancel any time.
I genuinely appreciate the support, and as always, thanks for watching.
-Today, I am here with Kevin more commonly known as the backyard scientist and as fate would have it
-We are actually in
-the backyard
-So I recently made a video where I converted a leaf blower into a snowball machine gun and the first thing
-He said was
-you should set those on fire
-so as soon as I got here today. We
-But flaming snowballs aren't actually why I'm here today show them why I'm here today, Kevin
So I actually don't drink but I've heard of people doing this with beer bottles, so either Kevin has some super powers
Or there's some crazy physics going on there that we're going to try and figure out today
So neither of us really knows what causes these bottles to break and there's a lot of conflicting [evidence] out there
But we have some of our own ideas so as firm believers in the scientific method
We are going [to] science our way to the right answer through a bunch of experiments. I'll drink to that not yet
You won't have it
I've heard that one of the reasons people think it's breaking is because when they slam their hand down [on] it
They're forcing a bunch of air into models and that causes the bottom to shoot out
So in this experiment
We're testing the pressure wave theory where when a person hits it with their hand they force a bunch of air in that then creates
A pressure wave that pushes out the bottom of the bottle so we put a cap on the top
So there's no way to force air in we're using a rubber mallet just to be more consistent for all of the hits
The bottle broke even though the cap was on and there was no way to force air in so we are rejecting this theory
We think carbonation might have something to do with it, okay?
So to isolate that we have one beer that's carbonated one with water, and then we fill this one with sparkling water
[so] if these two [don't] break and this one breaks. I think we've isolated that it works better without carbonation. Yes
So this bottle is filled with sparkling water theory is [that] it shouldn't break
And now for the beer
The bottle didn't break but that was interesting how much it fizzed up. So as it turns out
Here's why [that] happens when you hit the bottle it moves down really fast
[but] the liquid hasn't started moving yet that creates an empty gap down here. That's basically a vacuum or really low pressure
[if] the drink is carbonated the co2 from the liquid gets sucked into that vacuum and fills it with Co2 gas bubbles
Since these bubbles are less dense than the drink they rise up through the liquid and create a chain reaction
Of more bubbles as they go
But finally we test the water and just [like] with the carbonated liquids you [see] this vacuum form on the bottom
Except this time the bottle breaks so theory number two is confirmed
Non-carbonated liquids work better, but now we just have to figure out why what are they doing differently to make the bottle actually break?
so what I think is breaking the bottle is the momentum of the water going back and filling the vacuum is causing the bottom to
break out
And I think the break is happening a little bit earlier when the vacuum is formed like the air outside is at 14
PSI, and so it's in on the back, so it's it's before the water rebounds
It's actually cracking because the difference in pressure. We'll find out. round three fight! So we're going to add some red
Dye and then we're going to slow the camera down to like 7,000 frames per second see precisely
the Moment
So if I'm right, okay bottles it should break right there no
Yeah
Yeah, so you're definitely right it it ruptured when the water is coming back. That's right after it hits the bottom
So Kevin was right in fact it turns out that water cavity
collapses [ten] times faster than it formed which creates a Force higher
Than the [initial] hit on the bottle which is why it doesn't break right away
So now that you know the science if you want to impress your friends with this trick
Here are a couple
Important tips number one hits the bottle and not your hand you want to make as much
energy from your strike go into moving the bottle and not just being reacted by your hand you can even get the neck of the
bottle a little wet and then let it slip a bit when you hit it just to make sure it's moving number two like we
Discovered use water or something
non-carbonated otherwise the carbonation just fills in that vacuum and
Cushions the rebound Force number three a liquid with a high vapor pressure is good if you use a liquid with a high vapor pressure
That means the vacuum you need at the bottom of the bottle will form much easier
So hot water is a lot better than cold [water] because the vapor pressure is higher nail polish remover also works well for the same
reason [number] four be safe
This is glass and glass can cut you if you're not careful where it lands number five don't chicken out
It hurts way [more] if you don't follow through plus. You look like this. [oh], I heard it
So I want to say thanks to audible. I enjoyed recently listening to a book called ready player one
it's set in a dystopian future where people's main escape from the bleak world is to log into a virtual reality world called the
Oasis was created by the richest man on Earth
[but] before he died he hid an easter egg in the Oasis
[and] he promised his entire fortune to the person who could find it, but he warned to be successful
You would need to know a lot about 80s Pop Culture and video games
The story is really creative and intense in fact Steven Spielberg is currently directing the film adaptation

I bet there's cash
This is it escape room
It's basically where you and some friends are placed in a room and you have to solve a series of puzzles and locks to get
out in exactly one hour
and today I'm gonna give you ten proven tips to dominate any type of escape room and I say proven because me and six of
My buddies utilize these tips and even though about half of us
I've never even done an escape room before we shattered the long-standing record for this room by finishing in 38 minutes with no clues
Next we tried an even harder room to prove that it wasn't just luck and there again we finished in 46 minutes
And so the evidence seemed compelling but for further proof
I had my niece and nephew and a bunch of their friends first try a room without me telling them the tips
They only made it about halfway through at the end of the full hour
Then we walked through the ten tips together and then they went back to a new room with an equal level of difficulty and this
Time that they finished in 55 minutes with no clues now
you're probably thinking what qualifies me to be giving tips about escape rooms when I've only ever done three myself and the answer is
Absolutely, nothing. They're actually not my tips. I tracked down the architect and designer of the red bull escaping the wind championships
He's a college professor. His name is Scott Nicholson
The problem is I live here in California and he's way over here in Brantford, Ontario in Canada
And while that's typically a 12-hour trip through the magic of YouTube
I knew I could make it there in just a six second travel montage
Okay, so I am here now in Canada at the begin lab at Laurier University
With Scott Nicholson Scott. What the heck do you do? What is this place?
Well, this place is where I met games. Our focus here is actually making games to change the world
So a lot of the games we make here of some sort of learning outcome
Our goal is to help get people to learn stuff in a playful way
So professor Nicholson and I hung out together for a day as he generously spilled out the information
in his very large brain
He even put me through a few challenges and puzzles of my own and so here are the ten tips
I came away with after hanging out with him
the first step is to think simple think
Generally keep reminding yourself that the average person should be able to complete this room in one hour in a well-designed room
You won't need any extra knowledge besides what you can just find in the room people tend to overanalyze and just go down a rabbit
So for example in one room
We found the travel log of a robber and he went from Washington down to Mexico City up to Toronto
at first we were trying to look at the
interstates
He would travel on and maybe that was a code and then we're like maybe we should
Unscramble the names of the countries and then we realized his path
forms a V
which happened to be the first letter in a combination lock we were trying to open if you can't find a simple answer to a
Puzzle chances are it's because all the necessary information hasn't been revealed to you yet. So move on and then come back to it
Later, the second tip deals with searching
The first thing you should do in your to room is for everyone to split up and to start looking for clues and items
Professor Nicholson actually put me through my own searching boot camp to point out the typical places that things are hidden
There you go. Always look under tables always look under rugs
they write codes on the back of rugs other spots might be in hollowed-out books or in pockets of clothing or
Behind a door in the room a super common first-time mistake is to look in places
You should for example, you won't find a clue by disassembling a ceiling light or a power outlet
Another common searching mistake is to see Clues and things that aren't for example
The bottom of this chair has letters and numbers from the factory
But they're obviously not part of the room design because they don't fit with the theme
Going back to tip 1 the clues and key items should be fairly obvious in a well
Signed room and the more scape rooms you do the more you'll get a sense for what is and isn't a real clue tip 3
Organize your stuff as you search the room put all the clues and items in one location
So if you found three similar cups like this with numbers on the bottom group them together as you do this the bigger picture begins
To emerge and it's easier to tell what you're missing
don't let people just walk around with an item randomly in their hand that others don't know about you can ask before you start but
Almost all rooms have a policy where you use one clue or one lock only one time
so once you've used a clue or item put it in a discard pile and be sure to leave any key in the lock that
It opened this helps avoid unnecessary wasting of time when a team member is working on a puzzle
They don't realize has already been solved and used for tip four
Now that your team is starting to make sense of the room
laser
focus on what is stopping you from moving forward you are going to feel overwhelmed at the beginning even with our record breaking times about
Halfway through I thought there is no way we're gonna even come close to finishing
But then you solve one thing and then everything else starts falling into place to help with this work
Backwards from the thing that is stopping you identify that inputs it needs for example in this room
You see there is a lock here
And it looks like the key is right here, but you need some kind of hanger to fish it out now
there's a cabinet on the wall that
Probably contains that hanger and it has a lock that needs three letters and two numbers today
You can focus on clues that will yield three numbers and two letters you won't be as vulnerable to red herrings
So red herring is something that's put into the room that has no bearing upon the game. It can be something simple
oh, this has got to be really important clearly or if some rooms even have red herring puzzles that
Lead to nothing as a player. It's incredibly frustrating and so we've done some studies
So most players hate red herrings because they're waste of our time
About half designers hate red herrings and will not put them in their rooms and about half are like, yeah
They're okay to have in the roof by working backwards on the immediate inputs that are needed
You'll avoid wasting time on red herring clips tip 5 is about team rolls according to dr
Nicholson poor
Communication is the number one reason why teams fail his list of eight different roles that team members can be assigned which I will link
below
But the one that semen was critical in our experience was project manager
Because it helps alleviate the issue of poor communication. The project manager shouldn't get overly involved in puzzles instead
The project manager is the person people report to and say hey
There's a four digit combination lock over there and the project manager will call that out
Okay, everyone. We're looking for four digits. Someone comes up and says hey there's there's a five letter word lock there
Okay, we're looking for five letters. There's a poster over there. That looks funny. Okay
So everyone take a look at that poster if you're searching for something you might find it in that poster
So the project manager should keep an idea of what are the active tasks what needs to be done?
who's working on what and
Keep the game flow going, but try to keep themselves out of getting buried in puzzles
So they can keep a scan of what's happening
So the first five tips focused on it general team strategies, but the last half will be about puzzle solving strategies
you should be familiar with most common locks and their inputs because again if you're working back from what's stopping you and you know a
Lock requires three letters, then everyone could just focus on finding three letters
The standard key lock is the most obvious then a combination lock where you're just looking for four numbers in a specific order or here
Where it's a combination lock of letters and numbers
But five total then your classic dial lock where you need three numbers total and you start by spinning clockwise then open it like this
Then you've got this directional lock which is a little trickier because they can have anywhere from two to thirty inputs
squeeze down here three times to wipe it clean
If you need to try again
Finally you have one of these lock boxes that are again tricky because they've got anywhere from two to ten inputs
But it's good to know. They can only use each number once and the order doesn't matter
So one six zero five works
But so does five zero six one a critical tip of locks is if you're pretty sure you have the right code
But it's not opening have someone else try before you move on just given the pressure of the game
We have this tip save us on three separate occasions
and finally
you can skip trying to figure out the last digit if you know all the rest of them just by trial and error because there
Were only be ten options according to Professor Nicholson's research about half of all escape rooms will have some kind of code that you need
To decipher. There's a few basic codes
I've seen again and again and just knowing what they look like is useful now
You're not gonna be expected to memorize the encoding scheme, but it tells you how we're looking for an encoding scheme
So in the upper left anytime, you see dots and dashes you should be thinking Morse code
Usually it's written
But sometimes it can be lights that are flashing long and short or even long and sure
Sounds the upper right is called Pigpen cipher and it's often disguised as hieroglyphics. The key will look something like this
So see if you could decode the message then anytime you see dots in a group of six like this
You know, you're looking at a Braille key each letter in Braille is some combination of six dots and finally, dr
Nicholson said in his experience
The only time you might not get to the coder key is if there are a set of numbers ranging from 1 to 26 in
That case you match them up with a corresponding letter in the alphabet. So this becomes
H-e-l-l-o
Debate is about written clues. Dr
Nicholson created this challenge for me of the four most common styles of hiding clues in written text
Pause the video and see if you can find the four separate hidden messages here
The first is the most obvious with the bold letters. Look at the watch face
The second are all the words missing a letter. So remove the telephone
Keypad find the secret next and this one stumped us for a little while in one of the rooms we did is to just look
at the capitalized words
The secret code is 6 7 3 4 and finally if you look at the first word of each new line on the left side
The secret phrase is goodnight sweet prince
Makini TVs is looking for something that stands out from the normal pattern you would expect to see which leads us to our second to
Last tip look for patterns. Dr. Nicholson gave me one last challenge here. Now the lock that you have meit's indicates
You need to enter things in the order of a red green blue. This one is pretty straightforward
But what do you think the code is here?
In fact pause the video if you want to decipher all 3 codes on the board here. The top is 4 3 6
Based on the number of sides this one at the bottom
You just need to count the different colored circles and then enter them in that order
So 3 6 4 1 and finally in the middle, you see this digital numerical notation used a lot in escape rooms
So here the code is 5 for 7 apologies to my colorblind peeps out there because you probably couldn't solve that last one
Which is exactly the type of reason why you should cycle people through trying to solve the tough puzzles a fresh perspective
Is all it takes in many cases this helped us multiple times. And for the final tip your guide is your friend
Listen closely when they're giving their instructions at the beginning a lot of times they will give subtle hints about issues that trip a lot
Of people up you can also ask some high-level questions
like if they have a 1 lock
Use policy and even if you don't want hints you can ask them to prompt you if you're way behind where most people would be
At a certain point at the end of the day you're there to have fun
so it's better to take a hint and feel the excitement of escaping the room than being stuck on a
Frustrating clue for 40 minutes and finally fewer people is almost always better statistically
You'll have a higher success rate because you don't have to deal with the issues of poor communication amongst 10 people
But there's also a finite number of fun things to do in a room
So the fewer people you have the more fun stuff that everyone gets to do to quote from dr
Nichols's twitter my policy for the number of people in an escape room is the same as the number of people in a tent
No matter what the package says, you'll have a better time at half capacity. So there you go
Now, you know all the best strategies to dominate your next escape room
All that's left is to get your brain in shape and to do that
You got to use the logic courses at brilliant org on the off chance that you've never heard of them
Brilliant is an interactive website that focuses on just teaching science courses through intuition instead of memorizing formulas
But here's the trick
passive learning doesn't work nearly as well as active learning so they teach a principle and then they follow up with engaging puzzles or an
Interactive demo, so you actually retain the information you can access brunet org from your computer or use the app
Which is super popular with 4.7 stars from over 40,000 ratings
and so no matter your current level of understanding if you want to quickly get smarter about a bunch of different science topics while

so as more than three million of you
know last year bar to iPad tears with a
FaceTime video chat and a little bit of
duct tape you took over my label and
that's the engineer his name is Mark
Robert I created a costume that
basically blew a hole in my gut so the
most common reaction was a cool idea bro
but I don't have 1,200 dollars to spend
on a Halloween costume or as juicy pants
27 put it I have a great idea for a
costume - all I need is two Esther
Martinez attain iam donkey and a metric
ton of rabbit fur douche A to Z pants I
apologize so for this year all you'll
need is some kind of Apple or Android
mobile device sorry Zack that can
download a free app called digital duds
that I created with some buddies so I'm
gonna go through a few really cool
costumes you can make by accessing the
interactive videos and app for example
you take a video like this combine it
with a cool Muno shirt like this so then
you cut out as I and you duct tape your
device to the inside of the shirt
playing the animation and then you're
exactly this awesome here's a few more
examples
now all these t-shirt designs are a
hundred percent original so if there's
one that you really like you can access
it through the app or at digital does
comm here you can double tap or even use
your Apple headphones to extinguish and
reignite the flame Halloween is just six
days before the election so wear this to
show your support for one of these guys
or turn on dirt mode to show your lack
of support for one of these guys here
you can choose the picture that goes
inside the crystal ball so before the
party you just Photoshop yourself with
the woman your dreams and then when you
see you there if you like what it's the
future what can you do this one is
straight up creepy awesome so with most
of the animations you have options to
choose things like eye color and music
it's always some way to interact with it
in this case you can hook up your Apple
headphones and then inconspicuously
click the trigger to have them start to
stop
or you just DoubleTap so that's less
than half the costumes you'll actually
find 12 more through the app or a
digital desk comm including my personal
favorite the friggin 80s cartoon bad guy
picture frame like from scooby-doo but
for the grand finale I've got one that
isn't even a shirt it's called the I
wound and I designed it with my buddy
Christian you just play an animation and
then slip it into the pocket on the back
which is designed to snugly fit pretty
much any sized mobile device and there
you go here's an example of a costume I
put together 10 minutes with an old
shirt old tie a little bit of red paint
now I wouldn't actually comes with
double-stick tape so you could stick it
directly to your body or you could just
stick it to the back of your shirt so my
buddy raha took the eye wound out in
public to see what they thought and this
is basically what they not again so this
year what the other guy drops $70 to be
an angry bird
or even worse the rich jerk who can't
afford a disgusting and you can spend
four minutes prepping your costume and
then show up the work or the party like
a boss scenes in a t-shirt like it's no
big deal and then when he says what are
you supposed to be here you simply
respond with so feel free to use the app
animations to come up with your own
ideas
but if you want to take your game to the
next level you can buy any of the
original shirt designs you saw or the I
wound they're available through the app
or at digital does calm while shipping
Tobi right now
you
your person max
this is the board game guess who you win
let's play again guess who game cards do
not actually talk it was created in the
early 80s and it was probably my
favorite game to play as a kid just
because the rules were so simple now we
each had different guessing strategies
as kids but now that i've taken a bunch
of math classes dealing with
probabilities
i wondered if there was a way to just
totally dominate every game so i thought
about it a bunch
probably more than i should have but it
turns out there is a super simple
guessing strategy
that is perfectly legal that
theoretically will win you more than 96
of your competitive guess who games
i tried it out on a bunch of people and
it absolutely works
so i've been documenting the past two
weeks of my life and instead of just
giving you guys the answer i want to
share in the process
of discovery because i feel like most of
the times that's the coolest part
i'm running about 20 minutes late but i
am packing right now to take an airplane
ride to visit someone i haven't seen in
18 years his name is mr malloy and he
was my high school statistics teacher
basically i think i figured out a killer
guess who's strategy but
i want to pick his brain about it
[Music]
as a quick reminder in guess who you
each draw a card and that's your
character
then for example you could start by
asking does your person wear glasses and
if they say no
then you would flip down all the people
wearing glasses then you take turns
asking yes or no questions and the first
person to narrow it down to one
wins i think the biggest strategic
question
is whether it's better to ask broad or
narrow questions for example there's
five people with hats
so a narrow question would be does your
person have a hat now there's about a 20
chance they do and if you're right
you've narrowed it down to five and
practically one
on the other hand if you ask a more
broad question that applies to say
10 people there's a greater chance the
answer will be yes about 40
but because it was more broad you're
still left with 10 people to guess from
as opposed to only five
so my right is here but while i'm
traveling try and think of which of the
two strategies is better
i'll give you a hint one is definitely
way better than the other and the
difference
is the key to sort of unlocking the
super killer strategy
[Music]
and i'll just say i've had literally
hundreds of teachers over the past 30
years and teachers don't make a
difference
awesome teachers make a difference the
guy we're about to meet is one of
four or five teachers that have had more
of an effect on shaping me into the
person i am today
than all of the rest of them combined
each of those awesome teachers have
their own teaching style but i think the
common thread was i could just tell that
they cared about me as a person
and their passion about the subject they
were teaching was contagious
you'll see that in a minute with mr
maloy that's why whenever a teacher asks
me to like skype with their classroom i
always try to find time to make it
happen
mainly is like a fist bump to that
teacher for caring enough to do
something more than just reading from a
textbook
cool man thanks i have not seen mr maloy
in 18 years
and he is in this classroom i'm like
scared
here we go
how are you the years have been kind to
you old friend
so there's 24 characters right okay so
here it is i mentioned two strategies
earlier one was a more narrow guessing
and one was more broad
i always find it useful in cases like
this where the answer isn't totally
clear to sort of look at the extremes
does your person's name rhyme with
bralford
no so sarah's question is so narrow
it only applies to one person is your
person
african-american yes and thankfully
we've evolved but in milton bradley's
defense it was the early 80s and
casual racism was still acceptable you
see with a super narrow guessing
strategy
1 out of 24 times you'd actually get it
right on the first guess
but equally likely is that you don't get
it right until your final and 24th
guess and since it really has an equal
chance of being any one of those numbers
on average it will take 12 guesses to
win now let's look at the other extreme
with a really broad
question so the broadest question would
apply to exactly half of the characters
no matter if the answer is yes or no you
knock down half
so starting with 24 then it goes to 12
then to six and then to three and then
to either two or one
and then your final guess so in this
case you would always win
in five or six moves so any other
combination of narrow versus broad
questions
including the ten and five person
questions i mentioned before
would just fall somewhere in between
this gives you a huge advantage because
the game is intentionally designed
to ask narrow questions so prepare to
have your mind
blown but every single attribute in
guess who applies to
exactly five people so five people have
glasses
five have mustaches five people have red
hair
five have hats blue eyes five are women
five are bald blonde hair black hair
white hair
exactly five people even have big noses
and rosy cheeks
so given that every attribute applies to
only five people
how can you possibly ask a question that
applies to exactly half of them
there's several different ways to do it
but one idea is to ask a question like
does your person have white hair or
red hair or glasses now this is
perfectly legal since the rules state
you just have to ask a yes or no
question then on your next turn you just
pick some combination of attributes that
applies to half the remaining people
another idea would be does your person's
name start with the letters a through l
no it sounds right okay good i have his
approval
um okay and now for the hard part i want
to know what is the true probability of
me
winning with this strategy right i want
to know when i go into battle
against my six-year-old nephew right how
confident can i be
that i'm gonna win right can you do that
yeah okay
yeah statistics let's talk about it
well here's an example of a random event
happening there's 256 little bbs in here
okay
and when they drop through the hopper
they always make this normal curve it's
a random process but you do know
that the group will always look like
that it's fascinating
and what's also fascinating is that
anytime you have a bell curve like this
in real life
it always breaks down to the percentage
you see here for
each standard deviation away from the
average in the middle so for example
every time you flip that card over about
38
of the bbs will always fall into the
chute in the middle so even though your
strategy is better than your opponents
sometimes he'll win so knowing the from
the mean and the standard deviation and
the normal curve calculations we can
calculate how often he'll
win in three moves okay and how often
you'll win in seven moves say
okay and then if you multiply those
probabilities together using the
multiplication rule
you'll actually get a little square here
that says
what's the probability of that game
happening
and you can fill in this whole grid and
know all the probabilities
of a certain game occurring
and if you add these up we have 99
percent of all the outcomes of the games
you lose 14 of the time
and you got that by just saying two plus
two plus two plus two plus six
that is 63
this is super cool because these
percentages for a bell curve
match up with exactly what our bb showed
us earlier in real life
right so just to make sure i got this
for our hypothetical situation here
there is a 38 chance my opponent will
guess their person
in six moves yep now i'm a little better
so there's a 38 chance that i will guess
my person in five minutes so the chance
of having that game happen where
i win in five guesses versus his
six guesses is 15
and that's because 38 times 38
equals 50. yep you just multiply it's
just like a
a rectangular area just like old time
it's multiplied all the time
just like back in the day all that
multiplied now one of the things i
remember from your class is that
i can't just like play three games and
assume
that that's going to be statistically
valid right yes
how many games of guess do i need to
play to be confident that i have the
right distribution
you would have to play 625 games
that's a big number that's a lot of
guess who
that is a lot of gas sales so
i have 625 games to go but at the end of
that
my goal is to find the true bell curve
for the standard strategy and the true
bell curve for my tricky strategy
and then at that point i can populate
this chart and then i can add up the
pink numbers
right so that means if i sit down and
play my five-year-old nephew and guess
who i'll be like there's a 90
chance i'll win i'm gonna destroy the
underground gaosu gambling market in
vegas with one youtube video
[Music]
[Applause]
so it was gonna take a while to finish
625 games so i called up my super smart
buddy chad
who you might recognize from when we
built the annoying co-worker countdown
nes hack just oh gosh
and with chad's big brain and a computer
program he wrote emulating the standard
guessing strategy
after a thousand games we discovered the
typical guess who player
will take about seven guesses with the
standard deviation of about two
so when you plug that into mr molloy's
chart we find that the improved guessing
strategy will win
80 of the time now at the beginning of
this video i promised you would win 96
of your guest who games and the key to
get there is just to play first one to
five wins
guess who actually calls this
championship mode and they even provide
pegs for you to keep track of the first
one to five
the reason this increases your chances
so much is because of what's called the
law of large numbers
basically the more games you play
there's a regression to the mean or a
convergence to the predicted probability
so this dash line is your predicted
winning percentage but to win overall
you just need to win more games than you
lose
so you want to be above the dried
spaghetti line at 50 percent now this
spot here
is just pizza grease and has no meaning
so you might get unlucky and lose the
first game but then you win the second
game now this frozen chicken nugget will
represent the running average and right
now it's right in the middle
but let's say you get unlucky and lose
the third game
if the match was over now you would lose
since the nugget is below the spaghetti
but the lava large number states that
over time the chicken nugget will
migrate towards the dash line and then
just stay there
after a while you can see that even if
your opponent goes on a hot streak
the nugget doesn't move much and you can
pretty much guarantee
victory since there's no way we'll dip
back down below the spaghetti
this is exactly why vegas casinos have
no windows or clocks they have a small
statistical advantage so the longer you
stay there the more they are guaranteed
to come out ahead and it's also why if
lebron james ever challenges you to a
game of one-on-one
do not play best two out of three play
one game
first point wins if possible but you
know what i like a lot more than
children's board games
knowledge
this is a bird feeder and everything to
my left is my attempt at making a
squirrel trip if they want the birdseed
they will first need to pass through
what is basically an eight part ninja
warrior' obstacle course for squirrels
this course is extremely challenging it
is not for the timid of heart but out of
the gate I will admit that in hindsight
that I completely underestimated my
adversary now if you're wondering why I
would go through all this trouble when
you go back eight weeks ago when I found
myself stuck at home and very bored so I
installed a bird feeder and decided to
become a bird watcher and it was just so
lovely until they showed up now luckily
my bird feeder had a wire cage around it
big enough for the birds to slip inside
but small enough to prevent the
squirrels from getting the food and that
worked really well until right here for
me this was like the moment in Jurassic
Park when they realized the
velociraptors can open door handles and
once the door was open it was clear this
wasn't their first rodeo
they basically cleared this whole tube
of birdseed by the end of the day mind
you this bird feeder was advertised as
being squirrel proof so I bought another
squirrel-proof birdfeeder to replace it
it's got this outer cage suspended by
some Springs and so if a bird comes and
lands here it doesn't weigh that much
and it has access to the seeds however a
squirrel comes go grab onto this cage
its weight will force the springs down
thereby preventing access to the seeds I
have no idea how the squirrels could
possibly outsmart this but let's see and
this one worked exactly as intended you
can see the birds love it but when the
squirrel comes along the cage shifts
down and now all the seed ports are
covered up every time they tried it was
the same results however the next
morning this guy manages to unclip the
springs that hold the cage up which
means the cage stays in the lowered
position where it blocks all the seed
openings problem with that is now they
can get to the lid but this bird feeder
lid doesn't hinge open to give direct
access so he goes with a different
tactic where he now has access to all
the birdseed he wants and so I decided I
would try one more bird for your design
okay wow it almost feels intentional at
this point this one is supposed to work
well because it's got this
which is supposed to keep the squirrels
from just coming straight down and
getting into the seeds and more
importantly there's no way for them to
rip this off we'll see this one debuted
to similar results as he hangs by a few
toes this is what I really started to
gain an appreciation for what they were
capable of it definitely seemed like
this bird feeder was their favorite okay
yeah they're flexing on me for sure and
at this point a plan was forming in my
head but just to be thorough
I moved the post away from the fence and
I can't say I was surprised when they
just climbed it nor was I surprised to
see they could shimmy up and down a
small metal pole or even a large one for
that matter and was that they could
climb a certain pole material was a moot
point anyways because of this look at
this these guys are basically freakin
rodents eyes Simone biles and on some
level this is what it felt like when
someone stole a package from my porch
that didn't belong to them and I
harnessed that indignation spending a
year designing the glitter bombe package
hello
complete with special fragrances if I
could design a package to deter thieves
could I design a birdfeeder
to deter squirrels and so after a couple
weeks of brainstorming designing and
building with my buddy John we put it
all together in this 20 second build
montage
here are the basic elements for starters
here's where I've placed their favorite
bird feeder at the end of the course and
to sweeten the deal right below that
there's a trapdoor and if they step here
it releases a butt ton of walnuts and
unfurl some celebratory dinners why
walnuts I'm glad you asked
I'm using walnuts because over the
course of the week I put out of a Fae of
seven different nuts and seeds and all
four times I repeated the experiment
walnuts were always the one they ate
first what's great about placing this
here is it levels the playing field as
the birds can fly up and get as much
food as they want anytime they need it
the squirrels however will have to work
for it because the only way to make it
to this platform is if they work their
way through my eight-part Ninja Warrior
obstacle course which all starts right
here this is the only platform on the
course that has a pole that isn't
covered in slippery stuff which means
this is where they have to climb up to
enter the course if they try and get up
any other way they can't keep a good
grip and they just slide back down so
the first challenge is the bridge of
instability now this may look easy but
the trick is it attaches at a single
point on each end and from a physics
standpoint that makes it no different
than trying to crawl across the
tightrope it's the same deceptive
principle with that one carnival game
that's so impossible I broke it down in
another video where I use physics to
show which carnival games were basically
scams and the science on how to beat
them next up the maze of a thousand
corridors this one's a bit more cerebral
but if they make it through that it will
bring them to the pitch fork tumblers
which are inspired by the show wipeout
but unlike wipeout I should point out
that all these contraptions are squirrel
friendly and even with a little back
force they will break away and stop
spinning now if they can make it past
the pitchfork tumblers of treachery they
come to one of my personal favorites the
homewrecker
I put her in the temptu squirrel to lose
focus on the real prize at the end of
the course because this pad has a
pressure sensor underneath it and it
connects to a microcontroller that has a
relay that connects to a solenoid that
connects to a pneumatic piston that
connects back to this platform with the
pressure sensor and so if they stand
here for more than three seconds they've
got to start the course all over again
next up is the slinky bridge of
deception I'm suspended a juicy walnut
right in the middle but there's no way
this bridge will support their weight so
it'll be interesting to see how they
approach it the six challenge is called
the tourist trap it's actually a bit of
a reward for making it this far if the
squirrel sticks their head through this
board my wife painted it's just a
photo-op they can hang on the wall of
their tiny squirrel nests a place of
walnut here is an incentive for them not
to miss this unique opportunity the
penultimate challenge are the quad steps
of great elevation this is taken
straight from Ninja Warrior and this is
super tricky because these pads are all
totally smooth and placed at a 45-degree
incline and now for the last challenge
at this point they are a mere few feet
away from their ultimate goal but if
they're not careful they'll have to deal
with the orbital assist platform aka the
final countdown aka it's not a catapult
it's a squirrel of bolts which means
they now have to go back and start all
the way over from the beginning
now if they want to avoid that fate they
just need to stand on this pad for less
than three seconds but once again I've
placed a diversion here this would
projects an optical illusion of anything
you place in the bottom of this dish
it's actually super trippy and looks
even more impressive in real life
because the projected image is 3d
they're like nine bucks on Amazon and I
put a leaf that explains the juicy
physics of how they work in the video
description now with regards to squirrel
safety I know I seem to have this
reputation of
improvised high-speed projectiles and so
this one might worry a few animal lovers
out there including my wife we have five
pets and one child and the child was the
only one I had a say in so rest assured
I can adjust the pressure on the piston
and we'll be seeing way below any launch
force that could hurt any of our
adorable backyard contestants and so
finally after making through all that
we're back here at the world's most
satisfying bird feeder as far as I'm
concerned if they make it here they've
earned the right to gorge next to the
birds for as long as they want and so
after nearly a month of prep work the
course was officially open for business
they could smell the walnuts at the
final station and you can see the gears
turning because right above that was
their favorite bird feeder and so before
long we had our first contender that
[Music]
didn't exactly go as planned so Rick
decides to regroup speaking of which
that's Rick there are a total of four
competitors that will be attempting the
course first up is Rick and he weighs
500 grams I know this because he's
actually standing on a custom-made scale
Rick is very clever as you'll see here
in a minute but he also gets spooked
easily next up is Marty he's basically
indistinguishable from Rick Rick and
Marty are inseparable and pretty much
spend all their time together as a pair
our third contender is Frank also coming
in around 500 grams
he's very gutsy he's also kind of done
finally we've got my personal favorite
fat Gus he's just really charming and
will strike a pose if he sees a camera
he also really likes to eat any tips the
scales and an impressive 800 grams well
those are the squirrels are kind of
particular before making a selection and
then gracefully leaping away that Gus
just goes for it hands-free just makes
himself real comfortable here he is
laying out with a light snack from the
bird feeder I mean you can't fault the
guy for just clearly appreciating a good
meal so now that you know our four
contenders let's get back to Rick so he
hops back on and he's actually doing
better than his first attempt
just barely this is the best because
he's like okay I got this never well
maybe I know I definitely don't and this
was the exact moment I realized I just
might be outmatched here marty was
watching Rick and after a quick tip of
his toes in the water adopts a strategy
right out of the gate so close but an
excellent recovery in fact gasps perhaps
predictably comes up a little short
which brings us to the maze of a
thousand corridors which to be honest
they mastered this one pretty quickly
here's a solid run from fat gasps and
now for the pitchfork tumblers of
treachery marty was like yeah that's a
hard pass
bad Gus is just like abort Frank is just
like nope then he's like wait a second
hmm still nope then Marty flies in real
hard over the top he didn't make it
through but that's partial credit as far
as I'm concerned
and then here's bad Gus with my favorite
attempt by far and then Frank shows no
fear which helps him pull up this near
flawless run and finally smart Rick
surgically weaves his way through
essentially untouched and I should
mention the squirrels were most active
from 6:00 to 10:00 a.m. so every morning
I've been getting up before the sunrise
to start filming from in my house like
one of those camouflage nature
photographers only like a suburbanite
version I've also had a handful of
streaming cameras rolling 24/7 which has
allowed me to make such discoveries as
we have the world's worst guard dog
thanks for the help al now back to the
home wrecker you could see Rick is
instinctively suspicious of this gold
digger and only for a brief moment puts
his full weight on the platform I told
you is smart his buddy Marty on the
other hand
[Applause]
she is a cruel mistress and because I
know my wife is going to ask me no this
will not hurt the squirrel for two
reasons
number one they are amazing like cats
and always land on their feet
and two they themselves were jumping
from this height all the time and in
some cases much higher in fact squirrels
are one of the few mammals that can
survive a fall from any height because
they make their terminal velocity so low
you can see it right here they make
their body as flat as possible then put
their tail back to increase drag they
basically become their own parachute and
then right before they land they pull in
and fully extend their arms and legs to
act as shock absorbing landing gear this
is so cool now back to the course we're
even smart Rick eventually lets his
guard down which is exactly when she
strikes but just like all the other
obstacles so far after a day or two
they'd mastered it in this case even
disregarding her offering of a fresh
walnut now onto the slinky bridge of
deception and this was the sleeper
obstacle in my book that is not a large
gap which they can easily jump but
having the slinky there just threw them
off somehow you can see how much Frank
is struggling here and he's the brave
one and Rick only jumps when Marty shows
up for emotional support
but like all the obstacles so far after
a day or two they'd mastered it now on
to our third to last obstacle the
tourist trap and this one was just a
freaking delight a little peanut butter
really did the trick here
[Music]
now here comes Fat Gus and I mean how
fat Gus is this he sees the camera and
he's like paid to me like one of your
french squirrels yeah no no takers all
right here's another classic Gus where
he looks at the camera wait a second
play that back and freeze Jun enhance
[Music]
well turns out fat Gus is not a dude and
he's pregnant which meant I was suddenly
feeling real uncomfortable about all
those weight comments so after a bit of
a pivot to smooth things over we
soldiered on to the quad steps of great
elevation Frank comes in rather
confident almost to his demise but he
pulls off the smooth recovery so after
not much time at all they were looking
pretty good here in fact one morning I
notice Marty totally skipped the last
step altogether which I took as a
challenge and so I removed the middle
step to see what they would do and who
else but fantastic Gus let's slow that
down a bit there's such amazing jumpers
so I suppose the quick master here
wasn't a surprise I mean this right here
is probably a 10 foot job and here's
some classic brave but dumb Frank he'd
already entered the course normally and
made it to the homewrecker at least a
dozen times by this point and if for
some reason he decides this 12-foot jump
is his best course of action smart Rick
was the first one to enter the course so
in the end after about a week of effort
it was fitting he was the one to make it
to the jackpot first and he's so stoked
he apparently wants to run the whole
course in Reverse the nitesite we
probably should have made the jackpot a
little quieter here's Marty as always
not far behind
[Music]
he's also a bit flighty as you know
which worked against him here because
down below fantastic us ever the
opportunist comes through with the real
stroke of brilliance but pretty soon
Marty comes back like um I'm the one who
kind of and then fantastic Gus is like
you snooze you lose and let me just say
fantastic us when you sit like that you
don't look at Alice over 700 grams
eventually they learned that sound was a
good thing and they quickly returned for
the reward before fantastic Gus got any
ideas so here's a single camera shot of
a full run and by the end all of them
could do the full course in less than 40
seconds and while we're watching you
might be wondering what happen to the
squirrel apud unfortunately they didn't
really fall for my illusion much but I'm
about to show you the two times they did
and as a promise to my wife I turned the
pressure to only 40% full power so the
acceleration the squirrel would feel is
about half a G which is ten times less
than a typical rollercoaster
additionally I never turned on either
the homewrecker trapdoor or the launch
platform when I wasn't actively watching
from inside my house where I had a
manual override button because as safe
as it was something about launching
fantastic Gus just didn't feel right now
what you're about to see is gonna look
pretty chaotic but when we check the
slow-mo amazingly I'll show you how the
squirrel is totally in control pretty
much the whole time all right now here's
a second angle also even if you don't
trust my calculations I can assure you
that the squirrels did not care
in both launch cases they were back up
on the course in like five minutes
here's the slow-mo and see if you can
spot the two critical things he does to
make sure he lands feet down did you
catch it the first critical moment is
right here he's already done the
predictive math and he's locked his head
on the spa where he plans to land and
now his head will not lose that lock the
whole way down what's crazy is the time
it takes him to do all the predictive
math to know exactly where he will land
into lock his head is 300 milliseconds
that's exactly this long literally less
than the blink of an eye that blows my
mind but if you think about it it makes
sense these reactions would have evolved
to be razor-sharp
if you live your life in the trees
constantly making split-second decisions
and besides picking the landing spot
with his head the second trick is with
his arms when he wants to keep his upper
body from rotating he has his arms out
but the moment he wants to rotate his
upper body quickly he tucks them in and
then when he wants to stop rotating he
extends them out again this is straight
up conservation of angular momentum it's
the same trick ice skaters use basically
bring your lives in if you want to
rotate fast extend them out if you want
to slow the rotation my buddy Destin
from smarter every day also made a video
analyzing how cats always land on their
feet and they do the exact same two
tricks the head target lock and bringing
Lynde's in to rotate and out to stop
rotation here's the second launch and
this may look like pure luck in real
time but the slow-mo tells a different
story
in that amount of time he's already made
a slight lateral push in that direction
and locked his landing target with his
head we know from the previous clip he
can rotate his body to any orientation
but he doesn't in this case because he
sees his small push has already aligned
him for the perfect landing that's just
so cool and so after those two physics
demonstrations I disabled both the
launcher and the homewrecker trapdoor
and just let them enjoy the course in
peace as far as I was concerned they had
earned it plus after spending a month
together we were sort of broke by this
point if they saw me coming out to work
they would certainly jump away but then
they just quickly be right back and
sadly all good things must come to an
end and because I didn't want them to
develop an unhealthy dependence on my
handouts after about a week of free rein
I took down the course but in its place
I put up a specialized squirrel size
picnic table every morning this store
opens to release just a few walnuts as a
little treat to remind them of our good
times together although I had to laugh
that after all this somehow I didn't
anticipate on day one Frank would
immediately try and figure out and
partially succeed in finding a way to
beat the system like everything else so
they quickly caught on and now on some
mornings I'll catch them just waiting
for the daily ration chilling patiently
on the bench seat that is everyone but
fantastic gusts don't ever change buddy
when I started this two-month long
adventure trying to birdwatch I had no
idea I would enjoy squirrel watching so
much more it's also made me realized
that even amongst the
structures and pavement and powerlines
how interesting nature can be in a
single suburban backyard if you just
really stop the look even the plates are
amazing I had no idea that his vines
grow they spin around looking for
something to grab on to I didn't
anticipate the wide variety of animals
that use fences as inner yard highways
to get around as a substitute for all
the trees that existed before we got
here
even little interactions like this
spider extending his life with this very
timely leap into the unknown we're just
so delightful to see but of all the
animals I can definitively say now that
squirrels are my absolute favorite and
there's certainly a more formidable
adversary than for parks they're kind of
adorable incredibly crafty curious by
Nature athletic and persistent turns out
squirrels can live to be 20 years old
and so I like to think that someday a
fantastic gust will bring his grand
squirrels to the fence and regaled them
with tales of cowboys and courage and
legendary walnut piles if you find
yourself bored and you like the idea of
making a squirrel Ninja Warrior course
but you don't have the skills or the
squirrels then here's basically the next
best thing for my friends a Kiwi ko if
you somehow don't already know they
deliver really cool monthly crates that
are designed to flex your brain muscles
as a maker and a creator and be really
fun at the same time so for example this
one comes with kid-friendly build
instructions plus all the supplies we'll
need to put it together so there's never
any extra trips to the store each one
also includes a booklet that talks about
the science principles and where you
might see examples of this in real life
my family loves them and their
headquarters is like a 10-minute bike
ride for my house so I usually drop in
to see their latest designs like this
super clever air hockey build instead of
having it ski will have all the air you
do it in the puck check that the kids
started but unfortunately with Destin
and I they're turned into less long they
have eight different crate lines that
cover the full steam spectrum from
science and engineering to art and
design geared towards all different ages
as well so if you want to support my
channel and you
a really fun way to grow your brain in
all the right ways go to Cuba co.com
slash mark rover or use the link in the
video description and you'll get your
first month free this also makes for a
really great gift for any young person
in your life so thanks to kiwi coat for
being so awesome and thanks to you for
watching
oh hey I didn't see you there right here
let me ask you a question for your
Christmas sweater party why would you
wear something awesome like this when
you could wear something totally awesome
like this so this is the fireplace
mantle Christmas sweater idea which is
basically just a pimped-out sweatshirt
and then a mobile device playing
animation cut a hole in the sweatshirt
hold the duct tape and you're done and
you can even double tap it and the flame
will extinguish and then do it again to
reignite the flame to find the animation
just download the digital dub holiday
version through the iOS App Store so in
the app you'll actually find a few more
animations - like this glowing Rudolph
nose or you got this really cool snow
globe with the snowman or even variation
on that where you can choose your own
picture from your device to kind of be
swirling around the snow just a thank
you to the three and a half million
people last month to watch the Halloween
YouTube video on digital beds this
version of the holiday app is completely
free and then it's free to download
there are no ads and it's fully unlocked
so you don't have to worry about any
blame in-app purchases and well it's not
practical for us to ship you free
sweater we're doing the next best thing
which is through the app you can
download a high-res image which you can
print out make an iron-on which is
completely ridiculous and awesome at the
same time or even better you can come up
with your own creative design you just
have to be cool and send me like a
picture video of what you came up with
once again thanks for loved and we hope
you have a very happy holiday now go
dominate your Christmas sweater party
hey guys so this is the fireplace part
okay this - you see this furry thing on
my lip in the monitor I'm pretty sure if
Chuck Norris and MacGyver had a baby
this is how he would shave
Gotha my gosh this is a car and this is
a trampoline i designed specifically to
be strong enough to try and bounce a car
or i guess technically even about today
we'll be conducting some experiments to
see what happens when you drop all sorts
of stuff on a steel trampoline weighing
two tons with a mat made out of Kevlar
being held by 144 garage door springs
but understand how we even got to this
point we need to go back six months ago
when the guys from the how ridiculous
youtube channel issued a challenge well
you need to get someone to help us
engineer just an epic trampoline that
can dance like almost anything beak and
I've got Marky roba online and what you
need to know about them is that besides
having funny accents they do all sorts
of crazy things usually having to do
with gravity in some form or another
their content is always mind-blowing so
you should subscribe to their channel if
you somehow haven't already at any rate
a lot of people seem to think this was a
worldly challenge including myself and
so I got together with my buddy Josh and
first brainstormed ideas then we did
some math then we designed it in CAD and
ran it through a dynamic analysis and
eventually settled on a design and sent
the build plans to one of their buddies
who lives near the tower and so a few
months later all that was left to do was
walk to Australia to meet the guys and
check in on the build the mat is made
from Kevlar which is the same stuff
bulletproof vests are made of it's so
tough the only thing that could cut it
to the right shape was an angle grinder
the garage door springs can support
about 450 pounds of piece and we have
144 of them
[Music]
[Applause]
and so after prepping at the shop we
made our way to the tower to put it all
together
[Music]
after seven hours by 1:00 a.m. it was
all put together so after a very short
night thrust and six months of planning
the moment had finally arrived the plan
was to do 10 drops total five for their
channel and five for mine they started
with the single bowling ball but not to
be outdone and to stay true to the
tradition of my channel
[Music]
I chose a single watermelon and I get a
job right you're not the coach of you
through this mr. oh we are going down
here my also it turns out I don't really
love Heights I don't know how you guys
do this I'm just kidding the slo-mo of
that would have looked sensational
though to be honest
Wow so next up for them was 20 bowling
balls which was insane and you'll have
to watch it on their Channel after this
but naturally I had to answer in kind
with 20 watermelons
it's got Sacko Sacko melons right here
we're talking 2020 knows about 400
pounds that's a lot so they have these
tubes here for the kids to drop water
balloons down to lighten up with a
sandpit so I'm gonna try and film
through it see what I can see and let me
just say it's never cool to waste food
so we ate a good portion of the carnage
you're about to witness Plus food is
never wasted on quality scientific data
[Music]
and just to give you a sense of scale of
the monster we created here you can see
us standing next to a normal trampoline
and not only do we have twice as many
Springs as trampoline but here's a clean
comparison of the two sizes my primary
design goal was to have the Tramp
survive but I also didn't want to cheat
and use the ground to dissipate any of
the energy the mat had to come back up
cleanly without touching anything below
and now for the third drop out of five a
sixty six pound Atlas stone versus a
tramp full of water balloons
[Music]
just miss the friend that would have
been a jarring noise
[Music]
we're happy with that ma Walter come on
girl and while we struggle to hoist up
my second-to-last drop of a yoga ball
filled up completely with water I'll
take this opportunity to say that my
review of Australia was 5 out of 5 stars
they have cooler signs they've got
better snacks their moon is upside down
and their ticks are worse but their
snakes are smaller than advertised
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
it's not meant to bounce but a dig is so
Evan
[Music]
I feel like we did really well
good this time I had the balls the
intestinal fortitude to like look over
the edge and so finally after a bit of
precautionary light weighting on the car
the big moment had arrived
have you decided you're doing the cow
before but because it seems to be that's
what's going on so in case you know the
traffic's get busted at least I've got a
dope video you gotta look out for number
one you guys know that first of all this
is a hundred kilograms heavier than we
analyzed and it's like ten meters higher
I could see it hitting flipping over and
like impaling itself on the fence or
like hitting flipping over and landing
right up that's called that baby this is
legitimately the most nervous I've ever
been in ten years to make a video but
before we drop the car I want to quickly
explain why I was so stoked to receive
this challenge usually for my builds I
have an idea and a design and while
there's always testing I'd never had the
need to actually analyze something using
a computer a lot of you guys know I
worked for NASA for nine years but up
until about six months ago I also worked
at Apple for four years in their Special
Projects group and in both cases what we
did for this video is the best example
of what I did on a daily basis as a
mechanical engineer it's this loop of
designing something in CAD and then
analyzing it to see if it's good enough
and then you test it to check your
answers usually computers to analyze the
design allows us to build much more
complicated systems than before when
computers weren't as powerful this giant
ice block was from one of their drops
and you could see how close our analyze
prediction was to what happened in real
life this means that we can be confident
that trampoline would be strong enough
before we even built it and this idea
that we can understand and predict the
world around us using math and equations
is what first made me fall in level
science when I took high school physics
by doing that I can tell you will take
exactly point eight three seconds for
this egg to hit the ground there could
be opposing philosophies and governments
and opinions around the world and we'll
never get agreement on who is most right
but of all the scientists and engineers
on the planet where to get together in
hey
out they'd all be friends and they'd be
like yeah we solved it two and point
eight three seconds is exactly what we
also came up with and I find that to
just kind of be simple and beautiful
[Applause]
[Music]
gosh
[Applause]
[Music]
it's finished wheels down this how we
flippin bounce the car oh yeah so tram
that's the only bit of damage this is
where it plastically deformed it won't
go back to its original shape okay we
got a few of those that did that through
oh look at this
we just bent this oh we can one-inch
steel man car must have come down and
hit right here on this spot we didn't
want the car to hit the fence because
that would be expensive to repair inches
centimeters nay millimeters of clearance
the perfect landing
alright so you thought the car was crazy
now we're doing a boat we're doing the
boat I'm gonna end with the preview of
their boat drop but before I do I need
to tell you about how honey will change
your life and I'm not talking about this
kind of honey
I'm talking about honey the free online
shopping tool that magically finds the
best promo codes and apply them to your
car the way it works is you just show up
on any website like Target or Best Buy
and then when you check out this box
drops down and all you have to do is
click apply coupons and it scans every
promo code on the internet and saves you
a couple Hamiltons and of course it
works on popular items like air pods or
TVs but to prove just how much it could
save you I put the most obscure item I
could find in my cart click the apply
coupons and save myself 16 bucks on this
incredibly classy watermelon salad bowl
which almost seems like it was made just
for me and people freaking love it
because it's cumulatively saved them
over 2 billion dollars which is also why
has basically 150,000 five-star views on
the google chrome store and so now
you're thinking alright how much is it
it's free this is literally free money
and if you go to join honey dot-com
slash mark Rover it installs in two
clicks I repeat join honey calm slash
mark Rover or use the link of the video
description so special thanks to honey
for supporting this video and a special
thanks to you for watching and now for
the boat
[Music]
11 feet, 11 feet.
It's no secret that carnivals exist to make money
And to do this most effectively, they do a bunch of little tricks
to make you overestimate your chances of winning
in some cases to such an extent
that it’s basically a scam. So I spent a couple days coming down
to this carnival and observing and collecting data
on all the games. So I’m now I’m going to tell
you exactly which games are the biggest ripoffs and the scientific reasons why.
I even nancy drewed how much they actually pay
for the prizes you can win. But there is hope…because I’ll also
show you some legitimate tricks on how to the most popular
games and along
with what happens when you show up to the carnival with your professional baseball playing buddy
who happens to play for the Mets.
Let’s get started!
Any kind of legitimate investigation needs to start with solid data
as the foundation. So with the promise of unlimited churros,
I had some friends secretly help me collect data on all 24
games at the Carnival for a full day.
Not only did we collect
how how many times each game was played but we recorded how many
times people actually won each game and what prize they won.
And so the first observation was that based on our data
is tht this relatively small park
this place makes $20k/day just on their carnival
So to help frame the rest of the observations,
let’s divide the games into 3 groups.
1st,
You’ve got your Random chance games-
Games like these that don’t utilize any skills and are basically
rolling a dice.
2nd you’ve got your Skill based games
Like basketball shot or the milk bottle throw or the basket toss
game where if you bring some kind of skill or strategy to the table
you can increases your chances of winning
And the final category are
the games that are pretty much Impossible- These ones are borderline
scams.
There are 3 games that
lots of people attempted and nobody won, and if they did win
once like in the case of the ladder climb it was for a very specific reason,
which I’ll talk about later.
So let’s start by talking about the random chance games. Calculating
your chances of winning chances here is pretty straightforward. You just divide
winning outcomes by the total outcomes
and you’ll get a percentage.
So in this case there are about about 1600
total cups and 160 winning cups.
That’s about 10% chance or 1 in 10 throws
will win.
There are a ton of games similar to
this. But catch is they always use balls that are light weight and have a high
coefficient of restitution meaning they bounce really well.
The makes it much less likely the ball will end
where you originally aim it.
To illustrate this point, think how much easier this game would be with
bean bags which are heavier with and don’t bounce.
Any imperfection
in your throw is magnified, which essentially
randomizes things.
If you have no skills these
are the games you want to play. But don’t’ get too excited
because even when you win you lose.
I did some investigative work and uncovered the sources they order
their prizes from and discovered even If you got lucky
on your first throw that would cost you $1.50
for a prize that that cost them 45 cents.
But you usually won’t get it on your first try
and treating this as expected value problem it would
take you average
(7/30) 5 tries to land in a yellow cup for a small prize which means you pay $7.50
for something that costs 45 cents.
In the case of the big prize by landing in the rare
gold cup it’s worse and would take an average of
25 tries, which works out to $38
for a prize that costs them $6.
The number of people we observed winning matched up well with these
statistical predictions.Now let’s talk about the
skill based games. One of the most popular
the basketball toss with 825
the day we obseved. A standard 3 pointer is
about 24 feet back on a 10 foot rim.
In this case however, the line is 28ft back on a rim
11 feet high. Which is subtle but if
you have a deadly 3 pointer locked
into your muscle memory you will tend to miss short which is
exactly what happened a bunch.
The reason they always have all big sloped tarp in front
is so that someone can’t stand underneath the rim where they height difference
would be much more apparent.
Here again though even if you go Steph Curry
and sink your first $3 shot, you still lose 2.20 cents
because this ball costs them 80 cents Here is another example of getting
you to overestimate your chances of winning by making subtle changes by slanting the table
which will reduce the horizontal velocity after
the bounce so even if you played this game all through college
your previous experience almost becomes a handicap.
This measure your pitch speed game is borderline fraudulent
as their Radar gun registers about 15mph slow.
I know this because I measured the distance and then
 
filmed in high speed
and counted the frames and this pitch was much closer to 84 mph.
For the milk bottle game the only catch here is that the bottles are metal
which makes them more stable and harder to knock down than a normal bottle that size.
I’ve seen some carnivals where they are bottom weighted
which would make them even more stable and thus less likely to tip.
You can ask to hold it use the trick
of balance it on your finger to determine where the center of mass is.
They key to this game is hitting them right here
with a hard enough throw to introduce sufficient kinetic energy
but don’t throw it too hard because we noticed those who threw their hardest
usually compromised on accuracy.
About 1 in 14 of people knocked them over on their first try.
And then finally the basket toss game. The key here is to
have your first bounce hit on the front lip to reduce the kinetic energy
enough so it doesn’t rebound out.
About 1 in 10 people win this game according to our observations.
And now this brings us to our final category of the near impossible
games and there are three of them. On this first one, the goal
is to shoot out the red star with this automatic
bb gun. So the best strategy is to basically shoot
a circle around the start to cut it out.
Not only
are the guns not accurate or precise but the bigger issue is
that you start out doing really well because there is enough surrounding paper
so the bb will rip through the paper.
But Newton’s
3rd law tells us you can only push on something as hard
as it can resist your push and so at the end there will be barely
supported pieces of the star that just move out of the way
off the bb without building up enough stress
to rip the paper. Out of 120 plays we saw
no one win this one all day
This ring bottle game
is also impossibly difficult. Again, it’s a lightweight object
that is really bouncy to encourage randomness
but the actual inner diameter of the ring is really close
to the outer diameter of the bottle. This means any throw
besides this perfect one, will
send it bouncing away instead of settling in on the bottle.
If you really want this bear I suggest going to Amazon and getting it for $47.
I literally can’t even tell you how much money that wills save you because of the 840
rings we saw thrown, none stayed on. Which brings
up a obvious rule of thumb, if you want
to have the feeling of winning a game, don’t play any game that offers
really big prizes.  And for the final near impossible
game let me reiterate that for a carnival owner the most lucrative
games are those which the customer over
estimates their chances of success. No game is a better example
of this than the ladder climb.
There is a subtle issue
with this game that I think people realize, but don’t internalize the significance.
The ladder converges to be supported on the wall by one point
instead of two. If it was attached in two points it’s like
crawling across a bridge
which is really easy. Let’s pretend this is
you and If you shrunk all the weight of your body
down to the average location which we call the center of mass,
which we’ll mark
with this dot. Again, you know this is the spot
because it balances perfectly. If you draw
two imaginary lines connecting the diffrent support points
and as long as your center of mass dot is
it is impossible to fall off.
But As soon as you center of mass is even a little bit out of the area
of supports you start to rotate and fall off.
If you’ve ever bent over to pick something up
you actually know this fact whether you realize it or not.
In this case the region of support is between the heel
and the toes of your foot.
When you reach over you will
naturally move your butt back to keep your center of mass
in between your support points.
If you don’t believe me
try picking something up standing against a wall
so you can move your butt back, at the very moment your center of mass
moves beyond your toes,
you tip over.
In the case of the ladder game even though it looks wide because of the ladder rungs, it’s only attached
at one point but
even though it looks wide because of the ladder rungs
that area of support reduces down to a line. So
So if you don’t keep your center of mass directly above that line
you will start to rotate and fall
off. In other words, to win this game
you basically need to crawl across a tightrope.
And you might think we’ll I can do a slack line so I can do
this but a slack line is actually much easier for 2 reasons
You can flail your arms and legs out to adjust
your center of mass to keep it above the line
of support and your center of mass is higher
up which makes you more stable
In the same way it’s easier to balance this umbrella when it’s extended vs. when collapsed.
So while there are a few videos that say tricks like maintain three points
of contact at all times, they’re basically useless because
keeping your center of mass directly above a line
is just something you need get a feel for that
takes a lot of practice. But once you’ve had enough practice you this is the one game at the
carnival that is all skill. So you can win everytime
and clean them out. Unfortunately, the carnival owner knows this which is why it’s
the only game with this super lame caveat.
So now that we were carnival experts, I called up my buddy Matt Winaker
who played baseball for Stanford and was just recently drafted to play for the New York Mets
So we could maximize the chance of winning any game relating to throwing
So clearly Matt had deadly lock on any throwing game
But basketball is more my game so to finish off
the day I decided to bring his ego back into check
As it turns out, if you are a world
class athlete in one sport
you are a really, really good athlete in all sports.
So in conclusion, you should play the games if you think they’re fun
just know that the odds are heavily stacked against so if you
don’t win it’s nbd unlike this dude who lost his
life savings playing carnival games. And if
your motivation is to gain the love and admiration of someone
special by means of a stuffed animal you don’t need a
carnival to do that. Amazon works just as well.
“A little purchse for you ma lady”
Why?
I like to learn new stuff. I recently got a new camera but
user manuals are lame. So I went online to skillshare.com
who were also kind enough to support this video and followed along with
my camera as an expert axplained via video
all the different buttons and functions and
It was super useful and way better than trying to read a black and white manual.
They have a bunch of different courses ranging from photography to graphic design to marketing
to even making videos like this.
It’s less than $10/month and that gives you full access
to all of their courses. AND the First 300 people to
use the link in the video desc. get their first 2 months free to try it out.
So if you appreciate the work I put into these videos  don’t give me
money, click the link in the desc. and go expand your
mind and learn something new. Thanks for watching.
one of the suckiest things about driving
your car in the winter is when you're
already late for work
and then you get in your car and your
windows look like this some cars have a
single button to defrost all the windows
but a lot of cars have controls that
look like these
since you're in a hurry the question
becomes what optimal combination of
settings will defog the windows quickest
lots of people just blast the windshield
with hot air but what if you use
cold air and should you be using
recirculated air or air from outside
and does pushing the ac button or
cracking the windows help speed things
up and if so
by how much recently i had a
disagreement with some friends about
which combination of settings is best
from a scientific standpoint
and if you look online there are a bunch
of different theories from
self-proclaimed experts so as a firm
believer in the scientific method i
decided to test out my hypothesis
[Music]
so for the past 10 mornings with the
help of some trusted friends
i've created a consistent environment to
test all the different combinations
and then document and rank the results
and the punch line is i found there is
in fact a specific combination of
settings that will defog your windows in
less than half the time
i also stumbled upon some additional
tricks that can make a big difference
but before i reveal the best settings
let's get some understanding as to why
they're the best settings by quickly
reviewing the science behind what makes
a window fog up in the first place
for starters i think it's common
knowledge that if you zoomed way in
the fog on your windshield is just
little droplets of water we call
condensation and it's the exact same
effect you see on a cold can
or in a shower mirror due in the morning
your breath on a cold day and even the
clouds in the sky
all air around us has at least some
moisture in it that we can't see
called water vapor the higher the
humidity the more of this invisible
water vapor that you've got and as soon
as you get anything beyond 100
humidity it's too much and that's when
it clumps together and forms these
visible droplets that we call
condensation now what's interesting is
in a simple sense
hot air can hold a lot more moisture
than cold air
in fact at sea level if this cube here
had air
at 103 degrees fahrenheit that was fully
saturated at 100
humidity it would max out at 53
milliliters of water but if that
same cube contained cold air at 36
degrees fahrenheit
it could hold a maximum of 5 milliliters
of water which is
10 times less again this is a
simplification but i find it's useful to
visualize the air as a towel
that can soak up moisture how much
moisture you can soak up is determined
by two things
the size of the towel and how wet it is
already when you start to try and wipe
things up the size of the towel
represents the temperature of the air
because like we said
warm air can hold more water and the
initial wetness of the towel represents
the initial humidity of the air
so low humidity is like a fairly dry
towel that still has a lot of capacity
to absorb using this you can now
visualize what's happening every time
you see some form of condensation
on a cold soda the air outside the can
is really cold so it's like a big damp
towel that has been shrunken down
so much that at some point water comes
out in the shower the air is warm
so it's a big towel but it's so humid
the towel is fully soaked so it loses
its ability to absorb and
water comes out in the morning you see
dew on the grass because like the soda
can the towel has shrunk
and water comes out the same logic
applies to clouds or to fog
or to your breath on a really cold day
so for the air in your car to absorb the
moisture on your windshield as fast as
possible we want a big
dry towel knowing that it should make a
ton of sense why my experiments showed
that these four steps will defog your
windows the fastest
number one turn your heater on full
blast this is because like we said
hot air can hold more moisture so you're
increasing the size of your towel
number two turn your ac on this pulls
moisture out of the air
as the air passes over the cold coil so
it's like we're wringing out our towel
number three make sure inside air
circulation is off winter air is cold
and we know it doesn't hold much
moisture so if you bring it into your
car and then heat it up it has a lot of
absorption capacity and finally number
four
crack your windows for just a little bit
this may not be possible if it's
freezing cold or if it's raining outside
but cracking as many windows as possible
even for a few seconds
helps by initially exchanging the human
air in your car with the dry air from
outside now results will vary a bit
depending on a bunch of things like the
current weather the kind of car you
drive but do an experiment and try these
settings to see how much faster it is
over the way you currently do it
and if these are the settings you
currently use pound it because you're
already freaking bill nye the science
guy
if you're still having issues you could
try putting some kitty litter in an
inconspicuous sock like this and then
putting it by the windshield because it
will help absorb some moisture or you
could actually try
an anti-fog window treatment so here i
tested a normal windshield versus a
portion of the windshield i rubbed with
anti-fog liquid
versus a portion of the windshield i rev
with jurassic park shaving cream and it
turns out the anti-fog liquid helps a
lot
however it performed no better than
shaving cream so save yourself a couple
bucks so there you go
hopefully you learned something new and
you can shave a few minutes off your
morning commute at the very least
you'll now know this is just condensed
water vapor from a jet engine
next time a kardashian sister uses
twitter to warn us that the government
is poisoning us with so-called
chemtrails
About a year ago, I read about this powder
You could add to super muddy water like this, and then you stir it up and five minutes later
the mud has separated from the pure clean drinkable water. And as a man of science
I see this and it feels like nothing short of magic. I only make 12 videos a year
so I am really picky about what topics I will cover and even though I usually just focus on using science and engineering to make
to make totally ridiculous things
(Motors whirring)
(Glass shattering)
(Kids screaming)
At least once a year,  I try to make the case
that these same science and engineering principles
are also being used to actually change
the world for the better. For example last year
I met with Madhu Prakash from Stanford who was disappointed to realize the typical microscope and centrifuge to diagnose malaria
cost tens of thousands of dollars and needs to be plugged in.
So he invented a paper microscope and a paper centrifuge that cost 68 cents
that can diagnose malaria and require no electricity.
So today we're gonna find out how this was invented
How the heck it works and how it's being used to help people all around the world
But first to demonstrate this isn't some kind of smoke and mirrors trick
I located the nastiest water I could find near my house and met up with some intrepid field scientists. So today
I'm joined by my friends Cole, Kaden, Rainy and Max I promised them they could be in a video
But I didn't tell them which one or what we'd be doing. And here's the deal guys. We need to go into that pond
That's all gross and nasty and fill it up with muddy water. Can you do that?
[Excited music]
Do you guys think this would be good to drink this? No. What would  you guys give me if I take a sip of this
umm
20 bucks. 20 bucks? Okay, we're not gonna do anything to this one, but I'm gonna do something to this one
So then we can compare the two. Okay, so I'm gonna take a little bit of this powder
I'm gonna put it in here you guys see this and then we're gonna take turns shaking it for like five minutes, okay
(Chill music)
ew
Let's see what happens
It looks better
Okay, I'm gonna put my thumb at the water level so you know I'm not tricking you guys okay
Eww
(Water swishing)
It's some high quality H2O right there. All right, where's my 20 bucks Rainy?
Mommy 
[laughter]
Chances are if you're watching this video you have essentially an endless supply of clean water at
The pull of a lever. And because this is so easy, we tend to forget just how critical water is for us
You can live three weeks without food but only a few days without water and it's not just us from plants to ants to bacteria,
anything that is biological and living needs water to survive
It sounds crazy but there are no exceptions to this rule because of this when NASA is looking for evidence of life outside our planet
We first start by looking for evidence of water given all that
It's a total bummer that nearly 1 billion people around the world don't have access to clean drinking water.
Today, drinking contaminated water causes more deaths than HIV, AIDS, and malaria combined
And so that's why the powder in this packet is a really big deal
It was invented by a guy named Philip Souter
He's a laundry scientist at Procter & Gamble who was originally trying to figure out a way to separate dirt from used laundry water and I want
To be clear here. They are not sponsoring this video in any way
I just think what they're doing is really awesome and they deserve some credit
So I was actually able to track Philip down and he told me all about how it works
So essentially as three processes there's coagulation then the next phase is flocculation
And then the last piece is the disinfection. You start with clean water like this
But now it's all brown because it's filled with lots of dirt particles, parasites, and bacteria.
So you dump the powder in the water and as Phil explained, the coagulant part of the powder goes to work first
It's basically seed crystals that are positively
charged and because the dirt in the water is negatively charged, these seed crystals act like dirt magnets. These dirt magnets grow until they're each
about a millimeter in size.
The next part of the powder to activate is the flocculent,
which is a polymer which you can think about as having huge long arms that wrap up all the little
dirt magnet clumps and now they form bigger chunks as large as a centimeter. These chunks now are so big
They're just slightly more dense than the water, which means they sink to the bottom.
and finally, the chlorine is released and it goes to work on killing the
99.9999% of
All the really tiny viruses and bacteria that are left in the water that didn't get wrapped up and sink to the bottom
so now you're just left with safe drinking water at the top. This isn't just some PR stunt for P&G since
2004, millions of people in over 90 countries have used these packets and they've saved untold thousands upon thousands of lives.
In fact, they've cleaned enough water to fill a swimming pool
that is the typical five feet deep by 15 feet across only the length would need to stretch all the way across the United States,
over 13 times.
These packets cost them pennies to make which they sell at a loss and that feels like the right thing to do, but it brings
up the question:
Is there a case to be made beyond altruism where it's in the best
interest of the rich countries to help out the poor countries? To answer this question
I wanted to speak with someone in the technology sector who had some experience in this kind of thing
And he's a bit of an obscure up-and-comer named Bill Gates
But first I had to do a little bit of research in order to get myself up to Seattle
[excited music]
When I arrived they told me I was free to make myself at home while I waited for him to show up,
so I did what any rational person would do given the circumstances, I made the richest man on planet earth some pizza rolls.
Hi.
Good to meet you. Yeah, thanks for doing this. They gave me free reign of your kitchen and as a token of hospitality,
I whipped up a batch of pizza rolls. Oh wow.
I'll try it. It's not what I normally eat.
Its really hot, actually. They're kind of like lava in the middle. Not bad.
They're ok right?
A little bit of cardboard. What do you got here? This is plan B because I wasn't expecting you to actually eat one of those.
Dick's burgers. Love dick's.
It's a Seattle phenomena. Truth be told I actually knew this after seeing a picture of him on reddit.
He's standing line by himself to buy one of their hamburgers for less than two bucks.
Hate to disappoint you there's no Dick's burgers in here. Okay. We have some liquid refreshment
That's pretty dark looking.
So I took out the powder and explained to him how it worked and then I set up the bottles, and here's where we stood
after a minute or two. Looks like we're making some progress on the top there.
I'd rather eat these than that so far.
Why should we care about developing nations?
Well the amount of resource that rich countries spend in helping poor countries is pretty small.
It's well less than 1% of their budget.
I defend that because that money is so impactful. You're saving lives for less than
$1,000 per life saved. If you help the country lift itself up then countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, India
get successful enough, they grow their economy. So they no longer need aid. They graduate. Okay. Look at this
It's amazing the way that is small,
Isn't it crazy? amount of this thing
It's like magic and I like his answer that basically teaching a man to fish is better than just giving a man a fish.
What about the extreme case of a person who's just super
self-absorbed who might think I just don't care if a poor country has a fish or not, It doesn't affect my daily life.
I asked what he would say to that person.
The benefits are strong even if the pure humanitarian empathetic part
isn't the key reason. So then bill told me two main reasons we should try and help developing nations
even from a selfish standpoint. The first is for our own safety.
If a poor country receives aid,
it fosters education and economic opportunity,
which makes it more stable and there's a less of a reason for people to become desperate,
which is a breeding ground for radical ideologies and terrorism.
All America's top generals agree that foreign aid creates stability, which reduces the need for military spending and makes the world a safer place.
Additionally, Bill told me there's the issue of diseases. When the next pandemic comes, there's a good chance
it will be far worse than Ebola and it will spread quickly into the rich countries.
There's a huge benefit to us in helping these developing nations get their health systems to the point where they can detect and treat bad
stuff before it has the chance to go global. The second selfish reason for helping
developing nations that we discuss together was for our own prosperity.
After World War II, we think hey, do we care about Japan?
Well, hey then Japan, you know Sony and Toyota they're making good products. Yeah, let's not forget Nintendo.
It's a win-win situation, you know where we want
Japan to do well and make great products and you know, they're buying Boeing Jets, Microsoft software
and so having "hypothetically"
hopefully
The idea that other countries doing well, it's not a zero-sum thing
where okay if they do well, that means that it's it's bad for us.
Basically, we needed to get the Japanese back to a point where their brains could benefit the world again as quickly as possible.
Otherwise, it's a waste of human capital and the world never knows Super Mario Brothers.
Which raises an interesting point if you ask people who is the most intelligent person to ever live, you get various answers like these:
Albert Einstein
Einstein
Albert Einstein
Einstein
Albert Einstein
Mark Rober
Did I tell you to say that?
[Nods] What, you-! But the fact is with 100 billion people to have ever lived on planet Earth,
it's a statistical certainty that Albert Einstein wasn't the most intelligent human. It was some random person
you've never heard of probably born a long time ago who spent most of their daily energy
just trying to survive. That's why these packets are a huge deal when you have nearly 1 billion people spending their time
just trying to find clean water every day, that's a huge waste of untapped brainpower.
Now these packets and other aid efforts like them allow parents to stay healthy and gives them time to provide for their families.
Which gives their kids the opportunity to get educated which in turn creates more opportunities for the following generation
and so eventually, over time, the entire world starts reaping the benefit
from the contribution of this previously untapped human capital.
In this way some massive breakthrough in solar technology,
or maybe the cure to cancer or HIV might come from a poor country who is just a developing nation today.
And I find that to be incredibly inspiring and a worthy goal.
I want to thank Bill and Melinda Gates for partnering with me on this video. They just released the brand-new Gates annual letter.
I will leave a link to it in the video description.
It's a great read if you want to learn how life has, and will continue to improve for the world's poorest. Plus, you get to
be inspired by people who have just made it their life's mission to make the world a better place.
You know I get to learn a lot
you know, I'm gonna be working on these diseases the rest of my life. Bill Gates, living legend, eater of pizza rolls.
- Yeah, not bad. - That was fantastic. Thanks so much, bro.
Now we drink.
[calm music]
I recently announced a news that came like a thunderbolt in the scientific community
And it is that there is a group of small bodies in the outer solar system
It appears to have been affected by the gravitational pull of a vanishing massive ninth planet
This planet is 10 times more massive than Earth
It is 100,000,000,000 km away
And it takes 15,000 years to circle the sun one revolution
Watched amazing videos about the size of the solar system
But they're all still somewhat opaque because either they use pictorial models of the planets
Or it uses objects and distances that are not real on the ground.
So I'm going to try to solve that day by modeling the planets
Using haberdashery you can find it lying around your home.
And we'll put it on this soccer field.
We'll start by reviewing the size of the first eight planets
Then I will try to surprise you by showing the exact distance to the predicted ninth planet.
If you ask about the distance that the Earth revolves around the sun
Most people would answer something like this.
* At such a distance I think *
Something that can be understood somewhat
* Almost here *
*Here*
*Stop!*
Because all the solar system pictures whatsoever
Looks like this, so my solar system wishes
Which you prepared in fourth grade.
So, this is the true size of the solar system
And we start with the official size soccer ball that represents the sun
This puts Mercury on the ten-yard line
It is represented by a small black pepper flake
And after Venus comes on the 19-yard streak
It is about the size of a pin head
Next comes my favorite planet, Earth.
Around which an atom of salt revolves the moon.
So, if you don't remember anything from this video
Just remember that the ground is the size of a pin head and it's on the 26-yard line.
And another rocky planet
Mars, which lies at the 40-yard line, is also represented by a black pepper flake
Now we'll start to notice greater distances, farther from a football field than to the sun
We have a buyer who is the size of a grape.
After a little walk we arrive at Saturn
Which is the size of a grape smaller
It is located two football fields and a half from our football sun
After him comes the seventh planet Uranus
Which is the size of a pea
The average distance of its orbit from the sun is 5 football fields
Finally we reach Neptune
Which is also the size of a pea
It orbits around the sun the size of a football in orbit
It is approximately 8 football fields.
Now, this scene should help you appreciate the difficulty
To accurately represent the size and distance between the planets
In one picture.
Well, before we talk about Planet Nine, let's summarize what we talked about
We have a black pepper flake on the ten-yard line to represent Mercury
And then a pin head on the 18-yard line to represent Venus
Then another pin header represents the ground on the 26-yard line
Next, a black pepper flake represents Mars on the roughly 40-yard line
Then of course the asteroid belt
Then we get to Jupiter that is represented by a grape at the 135-yard line
Then we cross the street to reach Saturn
It is represented by a grape rotating two football fields and a half around a sun represented by a football.
Then we double the distance from the sun
Let's get to our seventh planet, and it's a pea that's 5 soccer fields away.
And finally, about eight soccer fields away from our sun, we have another pea, Neptune.
Thus, we set the general framework for understanding how far away the ninth planet is
Because in order to reach him I have to walk
I walk, too
And to continue walking with fast steps
For five and a half hours
Until I finally get to the pea that represents Planet Nine.
And while you don't see her of course,
You just have to trust what I say, which is right in front of us
17.5 miles or 309 soccer fields
There is an official size soccer ball yellow in the finish area.
In fact, the column width is that you see
It represents the scale of our solar system as we know it today.
On the other hand, this would be the scene as you see it if you parked your spacecraft in the middle of the haul to Planet Nine.
That amazes me
Our sun 17.5 miles away is relatively able to keep this pea in orbit.
But what's just as fascinating is when we consider it's in our Standard Model
The sun is a soccer ball that anyone can easily put inside the soccer field goal.
Not to mention that our massive star, which we call the sun, is considered small if we compare it to some other stars.
In fact, the biggest star we know would be if we compared it to our Sun, football
It will be the length of the Empire State Building.
And I'll finish by telling you the strangest thing I've learned about space while working at NASA for nine years.
But before that, I'd quickly like to thank SquareSpace for helping me make this video possible.
Here's a true story, several years ago while I was still at NASA
I had a crazy Halloween costume idea.
So I built an app and made a video on YouTube.
Then I printed huge amounts of T-shirts
Then I created a site where people could buy goods.
It was by far the easiest step in that process
She creates the site because I used SquareSpace.
Still to me it's amazing that we live in a time when we can in less than an hour and without the need for coding
To create a design website that looks ultra-professional and people can buy the goods you manufacture through it
from all over the world.
So if you have a great idea you want to launch
Or you just want to showcase your work or maybe your hobby
Go to Squarespace.com/MarkRober and get a free trial.
Then when you're ready you can use the promo code MarkRober for a 10% discount.
Well here's the coolest thing I know about space.
20 years ago astronomers did something rather dangerous
And they decided to direct the Hubble telescope
To the darkest part of the sky
For ten days
This was dangerous because time on the Hubble telescope was so limited
And there was a chance the image would go completely dark again
So they started exposing the image, and the photons would enter the telescope for ten days
It ended its billions of years' journey aboard the charge-coupling sensor aboard Hubble
And at the end of the ten days
This was the resulting image.
Except for these few stars
Every spot, smudge, and spiral shape you see in the photo
It is a galaxy containing billions of stars
Like our Milky Way.
And what makes this really amazing is the aspect ratio of the sky shown in this image
It's about the size of Roosevelt's eye in his picture, a dime a dozen when you hold it outstretched at arm's length.
To look at it another way, there are more stars in the sky
There are sand particles in all the stadiums, beaches, ocean floors and deserts on our planet.
When you are near sand, take a handful
Just imagine one of these tiny atoms is our sun
With planets orbiting around it
Then look at the hundreds of thousands of other particles of sand in your hand
Each of them has its own planets orbiting around it
Then while you hold her, contemplate how many handfuls of sand there are on our planet.
So I think that no matter how you see the universe it exists
The chance of being alone seems to be an infinitely small chance
This is a pinewood derby car it comes in a kit
Then you build it and put it together and then it uses gravity to go down a track
So over a hundred million of these cars have been built and raised by kids over the past 60 years which means over 100 million
Dads have spent a lot of time at the workbench, and then subsequently pretended their kid helped in some Meaningful way
But don't feel bad for the boys because someday they'll grow up to be dads
And then they'll get a chance to work on a car of their very own.
Now this is a much faster pinewood derby car, but wait
This was my entry. I was disqualified because apparently using jet propulsion goes against the "spirit" of the competition
This is a much faster legal car, but what is it about this one that makes it so much faster than this one
Really is it the wheels is it the weight?
Placement is it the axles and of the design features that influence speed which one of those is the most important for example do?
Aerodynamics really play a role so today
We're gonna use cold hard science to figure out how you can maximize your chance of taking home the trophy
With the least amount of effort there are a lot of opinions on how you build a fast car and spoiler alert
Some of those popular ones are completely false and at the end of the video to prove science isn't back true
I'll show you a car built in 45 minutes based on what I learned and then show you how to do
Competition so let's start with the fundamentals the pinewood derby is all about
Conservation of energy the amount of energy you start the race with it's the same amount of energy you form the race with it's just
A different kind so each of these blocks represents a unit of energy so at the beginning of the race it's all
Potential energy which is the energy associated with height?
So when you start the height of your center of masses on the track
The more of it you have and then at the end of the race in a perfect world all that potential energy
Has been converted to kinetic energy block 4 block the kinetic
energy is the energy of speed so you were really high on the track and as you came down all that height was converted into
Speed and you notice I said in a perfect world because in reality
We lose some of that kinetic energy to friction its dissipated through heat
But you will notice that these two piles of friction and Kinetic energy still add up to the original potential energy
We started with Energy is conserved
So if you can reduce friction that means you're going to have more kinetic energy
and that is the key
This pile is the key to winning the race because it has the speed term in there and whoever has the higher
Pile of blocks here wins the race every time so for the rest of this video. We're gonna discuss
What truly matters and amazing your kinetic energy or your speed or this pipe?
How do you make this pile as big as possible with the least amount of effort okay?
So before we go any further
I want to introduce you to someone I met while doing the research for building the perfect powered derby car. My name is Scott Act
All aerospace about Ten years ago my son
And I my wife's car out of the garage and we converted into the pinewood derby research facility for almost a year we conducted
experiments
And use the laws of physics to determine exactly what takes make a winning pinewood derby race car what I love about Dr.
Acton is that instead of just making blind statements like
99% of the information you find out there he used the
Scientific method does all the possible parameters that go into building a pinewood derby car and then he documented the results, okay?
So what did he learn after year of testing so here's a list of seven of the parameters he tested and how many car lengths?
You would win by if you're able to perfect that specific parameter assuming everything else was the same
So the first thing you should notice is by far the biggest contributor to increasing the speed your car is
Maxing out the weight of your car at five ounces and then putting it in the right location towards the rear of the car
so that alone contributes to
36% of the speedier car and you would be a car that had the worst possible mass placement location at the very front of the
Car by almost five car lengths if everything else was identical between your two cars
So why is this well if you put all your weight toward the back of the car like this when you're sitting on the track?
Before you even start your center of mass is higher up
Than if the weight was concentrated at the front of the car that means you automatically start
With more potential energy and since energy is conservative. We added two blocks here
We have to add two blocks on the other side of the equation which means you get more kinetic energy and again
That's the energy of speed which means you're going faster when you get to the bottom of the ramp
So another way to look at it is to say both cars will roll down the ramp at this same speed
Until they get to the bottom now at this point the blue car is done accelerating
But the red car has all the mass at the back and is still falling and will continue to be pushed forward
sort of giving it a turbo boost when it gets to the platform so now the question remains, how far back should
The mass be placed now the mass is too Far back
You're Gonna Pop a wheelie
and be totally unstable and clearly that's bad so doctor act and ran trials on 40 cars and
Concentrated the mass in different locations on the car and this chart is an example of kind of data that he produced so somewhere around
0.9 to 1.5 inches in front of the rear axle gives you the best times
So if you want to narrow it down even more than that it kind of depends on the shape your car the doctor actually went
into more details into this in a video
he made it's like 2 hours long it details all the
Results of his tests and even shows you like some tips and footage of how to actually fabricate the car
So we want a lot more detail than I'm giving here. I highly recommend you check it out
I put a link to it in the description of this video
So let's quickly run through the remaining list of the critical parameters light weighting wheels to give you a two car lengths
We'd everything else being equal if your race rules allow you need to take as much weight off this wheel as possible especially the outer
Edge or just buy some that are done for you
And I put a link of the video description of where you can get some now to explain why this
Matters let's go back to our blocks. I didn't tell you the full story when it comes to kinetic
Energy so remember this is the energy of motion and when you cross the finish like technically you have two types of motions your car
is translating but the wheels are also rotating about the axis now that gives us rotational kinetic energy now this green pile of
Translating Kinetic energy is still the most important because that represents your cars speed and this orange pile
With spinning wheels actually takes away from that
So if we can minimize the moment of inertia on each of the wheels by making as light as possible
Around the Edge that means more of our initial potential energy will go into making our car
go fast
And not just spinning up the wheels with a lot of energy so when you high center at the end the wheels are just spinning
Forever that's energy. We could have used to make our car
Go fast, so the most streamlined pinewood derby car is going to be to normal block of wood by about 1.4
Car lengths and everything else is equal now going back to our blocks you're not very aerodynamic
It's basically just a form of friction so essentially the more streamlined your profile is the fewer air molecules
You basically have to push out of the way
So you don't have to kill yourself here making some attempt to make the car a little bit more streamlined in the standard block is
Gonna be worth it using polished axles will be normal axles by about one point three car lengths everything else being equal
I was actually surprised this wasn't a greater tribute to overall speed, but drak around 35 trials of different
Smoothness on the axles, and this is what the data show
interestingly grooved axles are a complete waste of time and money if you look at the formula for Friction it really just depends on the
Two materials of the services rub it together and sort of the weight at that surface
so even if you reduce your surface area by a factor of two the overall weight acting at those services is the same so
Nothing changes, so lifting one wheel on your car
So your cars only riding on three wheels will be a four wheeled car by about one point one car lengths
Everything else being equal and most people say oh, it's one less wheel that's 1/4 the friction
But for the reasons we talked about that's not true because each wheel just has more weight on and the real reason this actually helps
Goes back to our rotational kinetic energy now remember the green pile is what you want to maximize and if you have one less wheel
to get spinning as you start going down the ramp that means that energy gets to go to our kinetic energy of
Translation which means the Faster velocity at the finish line
Finally adding graphic to your wheels and axles will make your car win by about point nine car lengths
Everything else be equal against the car that has no ground now there are several really expensive graphite solutions out there
but all the extra side pocket basically said
Graphite graphite that's Clever marketing our independent tests show that there's really no appreciable difference between one versus another
So there's a number of other parameters, Dr.
Act and discusses in his videos, but those six are the ones that will have the biggest impact
Relative at the time you spend on your car so in order to prove that science is true and to show that those six steps
Are really the best use of your time on the day of our big race here?
I decided to completely build a car from scratch in about 45 minutes
and then take it at the
Competition and see how it did so the first thing I did would just make a single cut in this block of wood so remember
Aerodynamics are important, but there's no need to totally kill yourself on it. Just a simple reduced shape is good
Okay, so the next step is polishing the axle
so here's a before and after
Basically you just want to take your axle put it in a drill press or even a hand drill and duct tape down the trigger
And then you just take different levels of sandpaper and just different water and put it on the nail
Yeah, you go all the way from you know 600 mm. Grit the last step should be some sort of polishing compound
I put a link to another Youtube video that covers this in a lot more detail in the video description
And then I went ahead and mark the 12 o'clock position on the nail head and this is why?
So in doing research to talking with a bunch of experts. I actually found two things that dr.. Acton didn't test
These are the concept of rail riding and the concept of bending your axles
So your wheels are canting so let's start with bending the axle so to bend the axles
I use this bending tool from dirty work
So right there you just bend the nail then you take it out of the clamp, and then you have an axle
That's been at exactly 2.5. Degrees
So if you don't want to go to the hassle, you could actually buy pre bent and pre polished axles online
I put a link to where you can get them in the video description
So bent axles are important for two reasons the first is that it reduces friction
And this is because as you roll down the track to weigh the axles are bent the wheels want to migrate outwards
And that's good because it reduces friction in the sense that part that's rubbing is
The wheel and the nail head which has a much lower coefficient of friction than if the wheels just bouncing around
Rubbing against the wooden body of the car the second reason. They're really important is it makes alignment a hundred times easier?
We'll get to that in a minute and now I just put the wheels on the car
And this is a good time to apply the graphite just get it everywhere
You really can't over apply it and now because I'm going our car to only write on three wheels
I
Deepen one side of the pre-cut axle groove in the front and now because it's deeper that front left wheel won't touch the ground so
Now you see. I am just pushing these axles in my hand
I mean there are tools that sell for like ninety dollars that help you align them and people talk about drilling the hole is just
Perpendicular, but it really doesn't matter if you're using cannon axles
You just kind of put them in the pre-made slots
And then afterwards I just use a screwdriver just to make sure the nails were actually flush in each of those slots
And it doesn't matter because with the cannon axles you can align it later
So this is where it leaves us at the front and left wheels rates it up off the ground you can see the back two
Wheels or can it outwards but you notice the front wheel is actually candid the opposite Direction?
This is the other thing drak that didn't look at but it was called the rail righty technique now rail riding means you
Intentionally steer your car into the rail that runs down the track and guides your car now
That sounds crazy like it's totally going to increase your friction and a lot of experts recommend spending
Hours and hours on a line of your car, so it runs perfectly straight
so the problem with that is no track has a perfect surface, so even the
Perfectly aligned car is going to bounce around on the track
So these bounces are incredibly detrimental because with each impact you're taking some of your kinetic energy
And it's being converted to friction and heat
Again Kinetic Energy in this pile are the key to winning the race so watch this slow-mo video of this rail rider car
I've built this is another car that actually ran pretty straight on a normal flat surface
So the key to the rail rider car is it turns toward the center rail, but just barely enough
So it maintains contact with the rail. So here's that you set up the rail rider, so get yourself a nice flat board
That's about 4 to 6 feet long and your car should be r about 1 inch toward the side that has the wheel raised
The length of that board so in this case it beer too much and this is the genius of the ben taxes
Because to change direction. We don't have to shim or glue. All you do is twist the Nailhead
It doesn't take much
And then once I did that it was just about right
So once again if you want more information on the rail riding alignment process I put a link in the video description
That goes into a lot more depth
And then you also want to check the rear wheels just to make sure they are migrating outwards
You should see a little daylight between the wheel and the car body and then again if they're not all you have to do is
get some pliers and twist the head of the axle and
So the final step in just getting our center of mass in the right spot
So I measure an inch in front of the rear axle, and then just to prove that ghetto is perfectly fine here
I'm using duct tape and then you just kind of balance it on that line that
We drew you probably never get the balance exact
But you just do enough to convince yourself that it's more or less in the right spot now
There are actually some pinewood derby racing leagues held on the monthly basis for adults across the country so I asked a few the experts
Who run them what do all the winning cars have in common and the reason I took the two additional concept of the rail rider?
And the canted wheel seriously is because they told me all of the cars that not only win
But are in turn have three things in common. They all right on three wheels and not four
They all rail ride and they all have canted wheels
So at the race my buddy
Mason won first place with an undefeated record in a field of 20 cars he even beat my 40 mile an hour rocket car
Although that probably had more to do the fact that my dumb friend. Troy sabotage my firing mechanism
Oh, so the rematch I would straight for the jugular
Now Mason told me they spent at least 12 hours building this park
focusing on the huge list of things that's
Supposable you have to do everything for and I have the fastest car now after the race I asked to borrow his card once everybody
Left I did a couple test runs his undefeated 12-hour car against my 45-minute car, and this is the result
in fact my 45-minute car Beardloss of this car of my buddies
And he's like an expert racer in fact this exact car has won many races even the district level okay, so in summary I recommend
maximizing the way to your car at five ounces and
Placing it in the correct spot on the car about an inch in front of the rear axles. Have a reasonably
aerodynamic car and have it right on three wheels
Lightweight those wheels if your race rules allow it and then get the been polished axle
So you could reduce your friction make it a lot easier to align and you can implement the rail riding technique
And then just run your rail rider alignment test and make sure you use plenty of graphite
So make sure you check out the links in the description for more detail on some of the steps
I didn't cover folie plus if you want to save yourself a little time
I have some links there that show you where you get some of this stuff pre-made like the bent polished axles
So this video is way longer than I typically like to make my videos, but hopefully you found it helpful
So above all hope you guys have fun and he uses an opportunity to get excited about science and physics and then use that to
Turn around and just dominate every other car in the race
I've always willed that bullet-time
effect from the matrix but the problem
is to pull it off like they did
literally costs hundreds of thousands
dollars so this is my attempt with a
single GoPro camera and a thirty dollar
ceiling fan so here's the rig down below
you actually have just a motor for the
ceiling fan which is attached to this
wooden platform right here and then you
can see the GoPro mounts right here when
we have two flashlights that point
toward the object in the middle that way
there's no shadows on this background
here and this is sort of the key because
relative to the cameras frame of
reference this looks stationary but the
thing in the middle looks like it's
spinning so you plug in the fan to get
the full speed so here I am cracking an
egg in real time and then here's what
the footage looks like
oh and there is this so I'd love how
this turned out
given how relatively inexpensive it was
but it'd be awesome to make a sequel
using an actual high-speed camera so if
you've got one and you want to do cool
project contact me via YouTube
that's me that's the richest man in the
world and that's the burger I just made
him but there's a catch the patty in
that burger is made from this stuff and
the reason I can eat it raw is just made
entirely from plants as you guys know
every year I dedicate one of my twelve
videos to showcase how clever people are
using science and technology to change
the world for the better so for example
two years ago was a paper centrifuge a
microscope that could diagnose malaria
for 51 cents versus ten thousand dollars
for traditional equipment and then last
year was a magical powder that helps
poor countries turn contaminated muddy
water into clear drinking water that's
also when I first met bill and earned my
forever respect after I microwaved up
some pizza rolls for him and he ate them
like a champ
I've been loosely following the progress
of plant-based meat for a couple years
now an allegedly it looks and tastes
like meat yet it's made from plants now
at the top of this video I feel like I
should start with a confession I eat
meat like kind of a lot I've had some
form of meat at pretty much every meal
since I was a kid my favorite genre of
food is barbecue and so be that dosnt
may as a firm believer in the scientific
method I feel like it's time for me just
to really buckle down and get to the
bottom of this plant-based meat thing
and so today on my quest for answers I'm
looking at three main questions number
one how does it taste and not just that
but how does it look and feel and smell
how successfully does it trick my brain
into thinking this is real meat number
two is it good for me if it does trick
my brain what the heck is in it is it
just some kind of like lab chemical
concoction and also how does it compare
to like the protein from a real burger
number three is it good for the planet
and on this one I have a hunch that it
is but is it like myth that's a little
better or is it like a hundred times
better now I should say a big motivation
for me and something I think even my
fellow meat eaters could agree on is
that the concept of factory farms isn't
great the whole cows that have never
seen a blade of grass thing and pigs
which by most accounts are smarter than
dogs
that live their entire lives indoors on
crowded concrete these factories are
efficient they're optimized for driving
down costs not for animal well-being and
I'm not trying to be a downer it's just
something I don't like to think about
when I'm eating my in-and-out burger or
chick-fil-a and it's a lame excuse but I
feel like I sort of never have had a
good alternative option I mean
historically this is
veggie burger and nothing about this
works as a burger for me but in recent
years the strategy shifted the target
people exactly like me basically try and
make it as close to real meat as
possible which reduces friction for
trying a plant-based option so their
goal is if I'm going meatless at the
summer barbecue instead of a quinoa
salad I can still enjoy the full
experience of a burger with my friends
and so on that note let's get right into
question number one throw this puppy on
the grill definitely sounds like a
burger and even smells like it and
you're giving like the fat dripping down
which is causing the flames to come up
so so far the experience feels pretty
analogous to just grilling a burger when
I looked the fork it definitely tastes
like there is meat on this fork alright
this cuts and feels exactly like a real
burger but before I officially taste it
I kind of want to know exactly what's in
there and to do that I'm gonna fly out
to the two companies who are the leader
in this space beyond meat and impossible
foods appeal me the first thing they
showed me where the labs where they do
all their research are these actual are
these actors or these are real
scientists and using this yeah this
feels like Jurassic Park you know and
like if the two are in yeah and right
out of the gate they put my mind at ease
and showed me a tray of all the main
stuff that makes up their burgers
apparently they work on not just the
taste but they have teams of researchers
working on the texture color the smell
the grilling sound even the same amount
of calories and protein as a meat burger
their goal is to make it as frictionless
as possible for people like me to make
the switch so they have these for the
color coconut and sunflower oil for the
fat so it sizzles on the grill potatoes
for carbohydrates and then these for the
protein the majority coming from yellow
piece these burgers are better for you
because they have no cholesterol but
they do have saturated fat from the
coconut oil so you shouldn't think of
this as healthy is like a plain salad
with no dressing
after getting the full tour I was
feeling pretty good so it's time for the
real test in the kitchen I've
intentionally kept my taste buds virgin
okay great I haven't tasted it and I had
opportunities like no no wait no
pressure
next week I'm going to meet Bill Gates
yeah and I have to cook for him you're
like a professional chef right I am in
the next like 20 minutes you need to
transfer all that knowledge from your
brain into mine okay we started with
their Italian sausage made of course
just from plants and chef Chris showed
me some power moves to impress bill with
on the grill I'm so scared
Cheers okay Cheers even putting flavors
side I think bill will be okay with a
bit little bit of a juice there's no way
I would have guessed I wasn't actually
eating real meat that's pretty good
cheers Cheers
that's really good new one more taste
this friggin good thank you next up was
their burger which it turns out was
equally amazing genuinely when you could
surround it with burgers stuff it's
really hard to tell they're like a way
to tell my next year puts to impossible
foods and they actually let me make a
burger myself just from the ingredients
in these poles so the first thing that
we're gonna do is add the water to the
soy protein and then we're gonna add the
potato protein the next thing we're
gonna put in is our magic ingredient
which do you know what of this is red
number five so this is our magic
ingredient it's called heme which is
short for hemoglobin team is responsible
for making meat taste like meats that's
found in every living plant and animal
you can get heme from soy plant I see
you don't have to get it from animal
next we added the cellulose based
culinary binder to hold everything
together and then finally the coconut
and sunflower oils do you have you done
any pastry work in your love tons of it
okay so you're gonna like fold on my
pace you work straining through you
literally just made the impossible
burger yourself like 5:05 both yeah one
of them was water one of them was water
so now I think it's time to cook one of
these up 96% of the folks who are
ordering our product are self-identified
meat-eaters I'm definitely your target
demo I grew up like if the meal didn't
have meat in it it wasn't a meal when it
delivers in that same characteristic
that meat does it really proves the
point that we're providing a no
compromises alternative for those meat
eaters out there to make a different
choice
this raised an interesting point these
been cleverly marketed with being a real
man because real men need their protein
that's what a man eats made from stuff
guys need like a
the truth is even meat-eaters like me
get roughly half their protein a day
from plants by eating things that
contain some kind of beans peas nuts or
whole grains like corn rice and oats in
fact many high-performance athletes are
switching to a plant-based diet because
studies have shown it can help produce
measures of inflammation by almost 30
percent in just three weeks and
inflammation makes it harder to recover
after a workout so if a plant-based diet
is good enough for Arnold Schwarzenegger
Kyrie Irving Lewis Hamilton Venus and
Serena Williams Nate Diaz and a growing
butt ton of others it's probably good
enough for me and my weekly rec league
soccer game
you can ultimately utilize this in any
way you would use traditional ground
beef tacos lasagna meatballs name it
they're so good this is a plant-based
burger and look at the mess I'm Megan so
obviously I thought their burgers were
also really good but I felt like I
wanted a larger sample size before I
felt truly confident feeding bill so I
invited some friends to a local
restaurant that serves impossible
burgers and the thing is you can't
always trust adults because they might
just change their answer to be nice
kids on the other hand are brutally
honest so we ordered them plant-based
burgers to
but my dad neglected to mention it to
them before he what do you think there's
no meat in that girl
your life plants I was a plant burger
you ain't a quiet burger
it just tastes like extra juicy and so
feeling more confident than ever it was
time to visit bill put my culinary
skills to the test and see if he could
help me answer my final question so I'm
back in Bill's kitchen he's gonna be
here in an hour and I need some
groceries so I've been working hard in
your kitchen perfect and I kind of
wanted to talk to you about clam based
meat and I thought maybe we could try
them out as well sure but as a control I
know you're a big fan of Dick's burgers
so it kind of cleanse the palate I
thought we could just bite that's the
real thing the real thing as a non
Seattle native I've got to say I think
this may be an acquired taste yeah you
get used to certain burger and so now
it's time for my cooking what do you
think it's quite good I mean that's
light-years away from what they used to
make like the traditional veggie burger
right you know the quality is gonna keep
getting better the the plant-based guys
are not done innovating eventually they
claim you won't be able to tell the
difference next up was my killer
bratwurst Wow and at this point in my
quest I felt like I had a pretty good
luck on questions 1 & 2 so I asked him
about number 3 the agriculture sectors
about 18% of overall emissions the
livestock is about half of that 18% Wow
and almost all about its beef is this
like cow farts cow burps slightly more
burps than parts but it's a mix of those
two to put that into perspective that
means that sector alone is responsible
for more greenhouse gases than all the
cars trucks trains ships and planes
combined turns out it takes a lot of
stuff to make a cow burying a fish
particularly beef is
eight to one use eight calories right to
feed that cow for every calorie of meat
you get up because you're building bone
and respiration for that cow now this
was a really good point I hadn't fully
considered if you think about it as
humans we're really solar powered we eat
plants but they get their energy from
the Sun then you might be like ah we
also eat animals though but they get
their energy from plants too which again
get their energy from the Sun so when it
comes to getting our energy from the Sun
animals are an inefficient middleman we
get on average 10% of our calories or
energy in a day from meat that might
sound reasonable until you look at the
amount of resources it takes to make
that meat compared to the other 90% if
you combined all the land in the u.s.
dedicated to raising animals you would
get an area like this and then Plus this
much more to grow the crops needed to
feed those animals now remember all of
that is for the middleman for 10% of our
daily energy now compare that to the
amount of land needed for crops we
actually eat ourselves directly that
relatively small chunk of land is where
the overwhelming majority of our
personal energy comes from and it's not
just land resources but water as well to
end up with 24 hamburger patties it
requires the amount of water you see in
this pool that same amount of water
could make seventy five loaves of
whole-grain bread and thirty jars of
peanut butter so if I made myself a
delicious peanut butter sandwich which
has nearly the identical amounts of both
calories and proteins compared to this
patty and then I ate two a day the meat
would last me a little over a week and
the sandwiches would last me a little
over a year so that's the same amount of
resources used same amount of calories
and protein to me per serving one just
lasted me a year longer because it's a
much more efficient energy transfer
method this is why a plant-based diet is
a way more efficient use of natural
resources we can feed an additional 3.5
billion people worldwide if all
countries just ate the stuff they fed to
animals and here's why that fact matters
particularly as people get richer they
tend to eat more meat if we don't do
anything this sector will actually grow
over time so you're saying not just the
fact that there's more people and a
larger population but as people move up
towards the middle class they want to
consume more meat and you can certainly
see that this is true when you look at
the amount of meat consumed over the
last fifty years even the resources
required a trajectory for meat
consumption like this is simply
unsustainable a few decades ago meat was
considered a luxury product but now it's
a commodity for a growing number of
people in fact the demand is growing so
much it now makes sense for farmers in
the Amazon just to burn it down and to
turn that for us into grazing land for
animals we've irreversibly lost twenty
percent of the amazon so far and that's
a double gut punch because now not only
is that more cow farts adding to climate
change but when you burn those trees all
the carbon stored inside them goes back
into the atmosphere as the greenhouse
gas co2 one of the great tragedies about
climate is that it's the poorest in the
world the farmers who live barely near
to the equator that all this heat and
flooding and droughts they're going to
suffer by far the most if you're just
trying to get people to cut back don't
eat me don't drive to work don't take
trips it's such a dramatic set of
sacrifices that everybody has to engage
in that without innovation we're
probably gonna go way past the two
degrees and that last part is the silver
lining plant-based meat is the exact
kind of innovation Bill's referring to
here and I'll optimistic because as the
demand for plant-based Meuse goes up the
price will come down much lower than
actual meat so then not only will the
experience be identical to eating meat
but it's better for you better for
animals and much better for the planet
oh and it also costs half as much it
just becomes a really easy decision for
people to switch in massive numbers
alright so what does this all mean now
that I've completed my quest for answers
where do I stand and I'll say it still
makes me really uncomfortable to think
about these factory farms or the Amazon
being burned down to make room for more
cows but at the same time I can't really
blame these poor remote farmers who do
nothing about what a greenhouse gases
for just trying to feed their family as
long as the demand for meat continues to
grow there will be an incentive to be
not cool to our mutual friends mother
earth so the most effective thing we can
do is try and reduce that demand so
after all this I'm not a vegan
I'm not even strictly on a plant-based
diet but I have reduced the amount of
meat I consume by more than half and I
feel great importantly
broken from that weird mindset that for
it to be considered a true meal it has
to have some form of meat so if any part
of this video ring true to you I would
say don't take my word for it try it for
yourself you can find plant-based meat
options in thousands of restaurants and
even at Burger King and Carl's jr. most
grocery stores have a whole section
dedicated to them so you can substitute
it into your favorite home-cooked meal
and remember it doesn't have to be
binary like you either eat no meat or
your freaking Ron Swanson if a bunch of
people did meatless Monday for example
that would have a huge impact on demand
some of the challenges we face globally
can feel pretty daunting and so I love
seeing clever people innovating on the
front lines trying to make it as easy as
possible for the rest of us to make the
right choices it gives me hope about our
future here together and inspires me to
want to do my part I want to thank
billable indicates for partnering with
me on this video they just released a
brand new gates and your letter and I
will leave a link to it in the video
description in it they talk about the
big risks they've taken in education and
global health over the last two decades
of the foundation and why for the next
two decades they'll continue making big
bets only this time in gender equality
and climate Bill's major focus on
climate change involves both mitigation
and adaptation to keep making progress
toward making our planet a better place
to live in fact I will close with a bit
of a teaser from the man himself you
know I actually thought of all the
toughest climate problems that livestock
was going to be the toughest now with
these companies and other ones coming
along in the space I'd say steel and
cement are now the two that that I'm
still scratching my head well if
anyone's gonna be scratching their head
to solve the problem I think Humanity is
grateful Bill Gates is the one doing it
so on behalf of I don't know the world
we appreciate the efforts you're making
in this I have some celebratory pizza
rolls last year actually they're frozen
you know I alright thank you
[Music]
welcome back to the final science class
we are live this is exciting the way
this works is you should know by now as
we start with the question and then we
have three clues to help answer that
question today's question is how do you
survive a five-mile fall with no
parachute and there's so much juicy
science packed up into this so we're
going to get right into this first a
very quick announcement as to why this
is my last class because a lot of people
have asked and I would say for starters
I wanted to do this class if we were
lined for three reasons one teaching
high school physics is my dream job so I
wanted to try it out and see if it
really was cool the second is it gave me
a chance for some mastery learning I
gave a TED talk on the SuperMario effect
I'm like I'm just gonna try this I'm a
totally fail but it'll be fun to get a
little bit better and then the third is
I didn't want to be completely absent
during this whole thing so just a way to
be a little bit more present so
addressing those three things basically
I've loved it
it's been really fun I still want to
teach even more so now the second thing
I've learned a bunch hopefully you look
at the first class versus this class
this one should be a little bit smoother
I feel like I've learned a lot and then
three things have stabilized a little
bit with this whole crazy coronavirus
situation so I feel a little bit more
comfortable pulling back so why not keep
doing it the biggest thing is it just
takes a lot of time I want to do it
right I want to give you guys something
good I'm still making my monthly videos
I've been getting up at 6 a.m. for the
past two weeks working on this next
video which is gonna be really crazy and
fun and then it's just kind of like it's
given me a new opportunity from teaching
this class there's an opportunity I'm
now working on in the background that
has to do with teaching that all will be
coming in the future at some point that
you guys will be available to you guys
and then the final thing is this has
sort of been a bummer with the corona
virus but the positive thing is my
schedule is cleared and I really have
enjoyed
running time with my family and I didn't
want this to be a situation where it
just came and went and I just felt like
I packed my schedule with stuff like I
usually do I really want to take
advantage of this so to be fair to my
family and to me and I'm really enjoying
it I just kind of want to pull back a
little bit but I'm doing great mental
health a lot of people are like are you
okay yes I'm great I'm doing all the
things as much as possible to keep both
my physical and mental health in a good
spot and I really hope you guys are too
that's really important you got to hang
in there we can do this okay
on to some science how do you survive a
five-mile fall with no parachute I'm
going to start with the riddle you're an
astronaut congratulations I can do that
I worked for NASA so I can just grant
that you're an astronaut you're on the
internal space station something needs
to be fixed someone hands you this
hammer you go out there you're fixing it
suddenly you realize you forgot to tie
your cable to the space station and
you're slowly drifting away what should
you do and if you're like oh you should
just do one of these things where you
swim back to the space station that
won't work and let me show you why this
is an astronaut they've got him right in
the middle and your center of mass it
does not move you have absolutely
nothing to push against you can't do
anything it's like being in the middle
of a frozen lake right no matter what he
tries there's nothing he could do he
could barely push against the air
molecules which is like what he's trying
to do but if you were actually outside
the space station you wouldn't be able
to do that so remember you're holding
this wrench and so holding this wrench
what can you do maybe you figure it out
already you want to throw it in the
opposite direction why do you want to do
that well our buddy Newton came up with
the law about this Newton's third law
equal and opposite reactions so by
throwing the wrench this way that's
gonna make you go back this way now the
wrench will be going fast because it
weighs less and you'll move back a
little bit slower but you actually will
move back which is why having a gun in
space is actually
of useful there are oxidizer so it will
fire and you fire it you'll go the
opposite direction so if you wanted to
go that way on the moon you just like
fire that way you're like you just fly
up so well a few weeks ago we talked
about inertia which is like how much
stuff a thing has right how hard it is
to move a thing so momentum is just that
inertia in action that gives us our
first clue maybe you've heard of this
word before momentum oh yeah I gotta
throw this momentum mass times velocity
okay it's like inertia mass velocity
movin so there's this thing called
conservation of momentum which is really
helpful that's what's happening with the
wrench and space momentum of that system
is conserved so by definition if you
throw this and you gotta move that back
move back that way so they kind of
cancel each other out this is true even
with let's say you on the earth you're
like yeah mark if I jump up technically
if I hit the ground the earth should
move down a little bit if momentum is
truly concerned and here's what's wild
it actually does the earth moves the
thing is is you were such a tiny wrench
compared to this big mass of Earth it
throws goes that way and it does move
ever so slightly the other direction
so this is a true law that holds true
everywhere now where else is this used
balloons you've blown one of these up
before so you should know very well
what's gonna happen if I let this go I'm
gonna do my best to hit the camera I was
before a job Oh balloon you have a list
pressure it's pushing air molecules out
that way and so by definition hammer out
the back the balloon conservation
conservation momentum has to go the
other way this is how Rockets work you
can't use a propeller in space there's
nothing to push against so rockets are
literally throwing hammers
out in the back of a rocket and that
makes the rocket go in the other
direction of course there it's a
chemical combustion and you have gases
that are expanding and moving out that
way and by definition the Rockets gotta
go the other way so there's even an
engine and by the way in a second we're
gonna get to this thing where I'm
breaking all these glasses with the co2
cartridge right after this next stop
we're gonna do that which is probably
gonna be a bad idea but we're gonna try
it anyways they even have ion engines
and ion engines are something we use in
space you're freakin throwing electrons
they don't weigh very much but you have
so many and you're putting them out so
fast because of conservation momentum it
moves this thing forward some of our
farthest space path spacecraft like dawn
are being propelled by ion engines
it's literally electrons being shot out
now do you know the farthest object
man-made object in the whole solar
system it's actually something called
Voyager this came from JPL it is 13
million miles away and if you're like me
13 million miles doesn't mean it's
moving 11 miles per second by the way
just fast think of something 11 miles
away in a second it moves that fast it's
the farthest man-made object ever to
help you get a sense of scale of what
that means if the Sun were a soccer ball
like this and the earth were a BB and
that is the correct scale how far out do
you think the earth orbits around that
Sun I asked a bunch of people this
question and in general I got answers
about like this or this maybe some like
this it's not their fault because that's
kind of how they're drawn on these
scales of a solar system so I actually
did a video about this I'm gonna show
you a clip from this video to help us
appreciate how far away voyager is so if
you retain nothing else from this video
just remember that earth is
the head of a pin and it's at the
26-yard line
[Music]
and as the final rocky planet we have
Mars at the 40-yard line
also a pleco pepper and now we start to
see bigger gaps and more than a football
field away from our Sun we have Jupiter
which is the scaled size of a grape so
then eventually I kind of summarize I
went through all the planets with scales
here's the summary which is also the
sizes of Neptune and orbits around our
Sun the size of a soccer ball nearly
eight football field so there in the
distance you can see the soccer for this
view should help you appreciate the
difficulty in accurately representing
both the size and distance between the
planets in a single image okay so before
we get to the new ninth planet let's
recap so we've got a pepper flake at the
10-yard line for mercury and then a
pinhead at the 18-yard line for Venus
and then another pinhead for Earth at
the 26-yard line and then a pepper flake
for Mars at about the 40
and then of course the asteroid belt
and then we make it to Jupiter which is
a grape at about 135 yards then we cross
the street to get to Saturn which is a
grape that orbits at about two and a
half football fields around our soccer
ball Sun then we double our distance
from the Sun to get to the seventh
planet which is a pea at five football
fields away and finally at nearly eight
football fields away from our Sun we
have another P which is Neptune
[Music]
and now we've laid the framework for
understand so that Voyager spacecraft I
told you about which is using normal
proportion its propulsion it's not
actually using ion engines but the point
is it's really far away it is you see
this distance here it's five times the
distance of Neptune to the Sun so on
this scale it's like two and a half
miles away five times this gap right
here is how far we've sent it and what's
so cool about it this is a picture of it
when it was flying by Jupiter obviously
an artist rendition this was made at JPL
which is really cool on it we have
something called the Golden Record and
on that it has instructions on how to
play this record there's a needle
enclosed in this here's directions to
where we are in our solar system it has
some basic information about atoms and
then on the back it has sounds of the
earth and in here you could decode it
and there's pictures of the earth has
music it's really cool Carl Sagan had
this to say
he said the launching of this bottle
into the cosmic ocean says something
very hopeful about life on this planet
if you need a good science hero Carl
Sagan's your guy what's also cool about
that is even at the speed it's traveling
at 11 miles a second it'll take 40,000
years before that little message in the
bottle is to our nearest neighbor so
40,000 years from now someone may find
that and be like wow this is so cool
it's a record of our civilization no
matter what happens here okay let's do
something super not advised in a live
class let me tell you the setup we've
got here things are about to get real
this is a co2 cartridge I've got a it
goes on this little track right here
we've put a nail on the front it's gonna
hit these glasses we're gonna see how
many glasses we could break and at the
back we've got duct tape kilt Ken here
he's got the view of the house he's
coming back for a guest appearance in
the last one now why am I doing this
well this is jet propulsion this
rocketry this is conservation of
momentum there's all this pressurized
gas in here it's gonna shoot out the
back hammers in space right it's gonna
throw some hammers we're just going to
move this in the opposite direction
potentially very quickly because it's
lightweight compared to all the
particles that it's going to be shooting
out with the pressurized air okay
so so much could go wrong here let's
just see what we can do
all right so I'm gonna count down three
two one then I'm gonna hit this little
nail which should puncture the back of
the co2 cartridge and send it that way I
might flinch we'll see okay here we go
three two one
I'm terrified that didn't work okay
sometimes it takes a couple tries here
we go three two one all right again it's
sort of bit my nail hold on check the
alignment okay I just need to hit it
harder I think okay try it one more time
three two one give me another nail all
right I do have footage from this
morning when we tried this out do we
have the replacement now we don't have a
replacement nail okay
where did I just throw that one I will
show the footage
let me try we're gonna try it once more
with this current nail hold on okay
all right I'm not giving up okay
line it up here we go I'm really gonna
go for it now three two one oh we
actually did puncture the back it must
be a bad cartridge huh do you give me a
new one
we'll get this if you have a new
cartridge
here we'll try it once more
I'll try it this one just wasn't full so
I was concerned that maybe they were old
alright here we go we're gonna give it
over try otherwise I'll show you the
video of how we did it this morning
let's see if I can puncture this kind of
bent the nail alright well here's what
we're gonna do we're gonna move this out
of the way we might try bringing it back
at the very end I'm gonna have my buddy
Josh here try and fix it and we'll see
if maybe at the end we could get it
going in the meantime I will show you
what happened and the face of my
reaction when we tried it this morning
here we go let's see actually not this
one right here
this is science okay a punctured and the
reaction so like I said it can be
dangerous we did modify the system so
this is what we changed it to here we go
is there sound Alex so that could be
what happened we made some changes to
make it go even faster which hopefully
will really show right in the very end
but okay here we go
we're live well that's actually probably
not such a bad thing because it was
gonna make a lot of glass so if all the
glass comes at the end that may work
better okay so you have this momentum
right something's moving fast how do you
stop it or even get it going now that's
a fancy word oops that's a fancy word
called impulse impulse is Force Times
time or it's it's the change in momentum
basically right now that's gonna sound a
little fancy don't worry about that
here's here's the demo we're gonna do
now we're gonna bring this sheet in if
you can help us out Josh I've got an egg
here right and I'm gonna try two things
one I'm gonna throw this egg against
this wall and then after that I'm gonna
strode it gets the sheet and I want you
a different egg because foreshadowing it
may not survive the wall in physics
terms I want you to tell me the
difference between these two things okay
you ready here we go now make a
hypothesis on what's about to happen I
can throw this in maybe 30 miles an hour
here we go it broke okay keep that in
your brain we're gonna do another one
right here here we go I'm gonna move
this here okay all right I'm gonna get
another egg clearly this isn't a
different egg all right you can see me
here we go I'm gonna throw it right here
same speed okay didn't break physics all
right help me move this out Josh and
you're kind of like all right
big whoop and I threw that pretty hard I
could throw that as hard as I want it
wouldn't break in the sheet in physics
terms what do you think is the
difference between those two it's the
same speed well the difference is in one
the time was very short against the wall
whereas in the other one the time was
big and therefore the force was small
these are indirectly proportional turns
so if one goes big the others got to go
small if one goes small the others got
to go big in the case of the egg hitting
the wall what was small the thing that
was small was my time and therefore
force had to be big in the case of the
sheet the thing that was big longer was
the time therefore the force was smaller
here's another way to think about this
you can see right here I've got this
little stick let's say that represents
the force of the molecules holding this
egg shell together right this is the
impulse the total number of blocks can't
change it's the same at any point if you
spike above this line the molecules that
the force is holding out of the eggshell
you're gonna break the eggshell okay but
what you can do is if you can flatten
the curve along this axis is time if I
can take I take those same amount of
blocks I can't get rid of blocks but I
can take them if I rearrange them so now
the event just takes longer look what
happens I'm underneath this line now
right I stay beneath that curve I
flatten to the curve and as a result the
egg survives there's no moment where it
spikes up and gets bigger okay
we're kind of narrowing in on what the
answer is so then why the heck do we
have airbags and cars right keep this in
mind
what do airbags and cars do well they
extend to the top
it takes for you to stop as opposed to
hitting the steering we're really fast
therefore what happens longer time you
flatten the curve you stretch this out
the force is gonna be less right where
else do you see this long jumpers when
they're jumping do they land in asphalt
no what do they land in sand well what's
the deal with sand well all sand does is
it lengthens the time stretches it out
of the event the change of momentum the
impulse to happen to go from moving fast
to stopped right how about with your
phone even the difference of dropping
your phone unlike a wooden floor versus
a marble floor which is gonna break more
well going back to this right here this
is the the strength of your iPhone of
the phone's glass holding it together on
marble you're just gonna get this spike
it's gonna it's gonna happen shorter
because it's harder whereas even wood
floor which seems pretty hard it's
enough of a difference fractions of a
millisecond that keep it below the line
and it won't break parkour right people
do parkour they jump off crazy things
what do they do they roll what does
rolling do well that extends the time
for which you stop versus just stopping
yourself in fact if you bend your knees
versus locking your knees it's like 10
to 20 times less force just by bending
your knees jumping off something versus
keeping them locked check out this clip
right here of this guy jumping off this
roof that seems insane right
thinking about it
you see here he ripped his pants a
little bit
but what was the trick to making that
happen time he slid down the roof which
allowed him to lengthen the time for the
event to occur even cars they used the
thought was like oh we should make these
as strong as rigid as possible really
rigid like steel don't bend at all turns
out that's the wrong thing because the
time is then short and it's like you hit
really hard now cars are designed to
actually crumple they crumple and crush
all it's doing extending the time and as
a result so many more people lived
through car accidents than they used to
okay what about this principle in the
opposite where's the case where you
might want to have a high force how
about with karate' if you're breaking a
wood board this is why you shouldn't
chicken out if you're trying to break a
wood board and you should follow through
because you want to hit this spike as
quickly as possible because if you do
that and you break the board there's
nothing left you actually get a cheat
and not have these there you have a
momentarily you know it hurts your hand
just for a second but once you break it
there's nothing left right the worst
thing you can do in that situation
is chicken out so you get right up to
this line and then you stay underneath
it because then it's like oh all that
energy is going to your hand where if
you do just committed to it you could
really quickly broken it and be done
with it another example here's a rubber
hammer versus a metal hammer and you
wouldn't think it makes such a big
difference but this is more effective at
hammering in nails except from in the
case mine because it's harder so it's a
shorter time bigger force you want to
use the rubber nail if you don't want to
like damage something as little as that
seems to make a difference that tiny
little difference in stiffness means
that the length is just a little bit
longer what if you want to increase
your momentum right so let's say you're
hunting or whatever a bow and arrow
target if you pull it back just a little
bit you really want the more time as
possible Force Times time equals your
change in momentum
that's why pulling it back is better you
have more time for it to be under force
of the string you're gonna have more
momentum for your arrow same with like a
gun a longer barrel means it will go
faster because it just has more time to
be under the force of the gasses coming
out and a rifle goes faster than a
handgun yeah also with sports golf
tennis whatever the reason you follow
through is you want to extend the time
you have against the force so anyways I
could go on but the point is I love this
when one little nugget one little
equation just one little you know mental
model to have in your brain can explain
so many things in the real world so clue
3 it's all about time and that's what I
want you to remember this
right it's about the time it takes for
the event to be slowed down is
proportional to how much it hurts so
when we're talking about how to survive
a 5-mile fall with no parachute what are
you thinking just somehow you don't want
that to be an instantaneous end
how can you lengthen out the time well
this actually happened a dude fell from
2,000 feet his parachute failed this is
him right here
his name is Paul Lewis this is in 2009
he landed on the roof his parachute
failed he landed on the roof of an
airplane hangar and was one of those
metal really flexi roofs and he ran in
and in just the right spot and the time
was long enough for the deceleration
that he didn't even break any bones he
he did say after that he wasn't gonna go
skydiving again which I really can't
blame him and then specifically for our
answer there was actually a guy who fell
from five miles and this is the clip
right here five miles up
he's got no parachute check out what
and the crowd on the ground looking up
they have a visual on him right now
he's in
[Applause]
and he's kicking and moving
from here and look perfect you just so
he used the net but you really could
have you could have used anything right
you could have used a platform with
rockets you could add rockets on his
back you know that's where people do use
packing peanuts anything to just extend
the time for him to land he chose to use
in that so if you want to know how to
survive with no parachute just figure
out some way to extend the time maybe
take a big big big bucket of packing
peanuts okay so I'm gonna leave you with
the final thought alright this is it and
it's to stay curious
before I get into this final thought
though you can come back to me Alex
we're gonna try this one more time I've
been informed for my massive quarantine
level crew here of three of us that we
may be in good shape again so we're just
go try it if it doesn't work just know
that I still love you but if it does
then it'll be heroic okay here we go
alright so let's just see what happens
all right
don't be mad at me if this doesn't work
this is live this is what you get is
what you pay for
here we go three I'm waiting for the
camera guy over here okay here we go
ready Josh good okay three two
oh I glasses with safety first okay
three two one there you go boom what a
way to end science class and for the
record duct tape killed Ken this looking
great is is kill fell down a little in
the back but other than that yeah we're
in good shape
dr. croquette that was a PC my part is
totally racing oh yeah my final thought
is to stay curious okay we will have
science class here but every day can be
a science class for you all right the
key to that is observation if you're
observing the world around you and just
makes you thinking about things and
wondering and asking questions you have
Google you can answer these questions I
love to think of things to talk with
with my friends who loved and talked
about these types of things as well just
random questions so if you don't have
someone to find your tribe isn't online
find people who like to talk about this
stuff especially science stuff I just
want to give you an example of this
I've got driving in the car I have my
laptop down here because I knew a good
glass on it we can go to the laptop
screen Alex so driving in the car I here
are a couple questions
you know I was just thinking what's an
example what I mean by stay curious let
me just give you some questions that
I've thought of in the scenario of being
in my car all right
what why do these rail why do you signs
like this have these holes at the bottom
you ever thought about that have you
ever even seen that right so step one of
the scientific method is observing why
is that they have to do with crashes I'm
not going to tell you the answer these I
want you to wonder yourself why do some
of these trucks have these little doors
on the back what's the purpose of those
cute little doors I'll give you a clue
that tends to be refrigerated trucks
what's the purpose of these things have
you ever even noticed them before
they're actually pretty common they go
around the nuts what might those before
again this is sort of a safety thing
that makes visually useful safety check
how do people how do they know and
people when cars are at lice someone
told me once they have scales and that
never made sense to me I don't think
scales there's a different way maybe
you've seen these cuts in the concrete
have to do with induction and wires of
current magnetic fields how are things
reflective a normal sign is on the left
but just with your headlights these
signs
becomes so they almost like shine back
at you completely passive passes with a
retroreflection
so all of these things are like Google
Bowl hopefully some of these get your
heart pump and you're like yeah these
are good questions what's the purpose of
these things this actually has a lot to
do with our class today right here okay
clue is that they're filled a lot of
times with water or sand so I'm gonna
leave you guys with that I will say for
me per like even with my wife she's an
English major so we make a great combo
and you know a lot of times I'll be like
have you ever wondered why she's like oh
boy here we go again right so when we
spend like a certain amount of time
talking about nerdy stuff we got to talk
about like feelings and stuff to keep it
balanced conservation of conversation
that's one of Newton's fourth principle
I think but yeah or sometimes we'll just
be like hugging or whatever we'll be
like talking and they'll be like a lull
in the conversation she'd be like are
you thinking about like your next video
and you know sometimes I'm guilty like I
give these things in my head and I'm
stoked about them and I think about them
and it's just like a great rewarding way
to with live life where you're curious
about the natural world around you and
you try and find the answers so even
though we won't have science class here
you have science class in your heart
forever more and hopefully what we've
done here has helped instill that
passion within you so be good prioritize
your physical and your mental health and
I'll see you guys around on the Internet
and as always thanks for watching
[Music]
I saw this video on Twitter with over five million views and then again on YouTube with nearly 1 million views
Basically, this guy modified his cellphone case with propellers to take selfies
Which is awesome my only issue with it is that it's not only fake, but it's a scam which I'll explain in a minute
but as for being fake
The first clue is that these are three volts seven millimeter micro brush motors like you see here if you attach one to a beam
Like this and turn it on at full throttle you'll see the most weight that it can lift is six quarters or about thirty grams.
The cell phone in the video with all the flying gear attached would weigh about 300 grams
and since drones are typically designed to hover at 70% max thrust you would need at least
15 of these motors to do what he did, but you know, this just doesn't look as catchy
In fact, we recreated the exact setup
he used in the video and turn the motors to full throttle and this is what happened here.
Here it is in slow mo and as you can see there's hardly any difference than if you don't turn the propellers on at all
so I'm gonna show you how this scam artist somehow manages to break the laws of physics four more times in this three-minute video and
then because obeying laws of physics isn't optional
we're gonna call a fellow youtuber Captain Disillusion to see if he can help us spot any signs of a special effects. And then
with my buddy Peter Sripol i'm going to show you what it would take to
Actually build a flying selfie phone case and then i'll put all the details on a new set. I built using wix.com.
But, before I do any of that
let me first explain why this is a scam and not just a harmless fake video for meaningless internet points.  With this many views and
An astounding 80% like ratio, which means most people probably didn't realize it was fake
It's a statistical certainty that some young aspiring engineer
actually tried to build this themselves
worse than their parents phone dropping like a rock and breaking
this might have been his or her first experience at making something.  But, how you might ask would they know what components to use well?
here in the description amazing maker was kind enough to put links Amazon affiliate links
you can tell by the URLs.
So he is making money off the crushed dreams of aspiring engineers without enough experience yet to this is total BS and aspiring engineers
are my people, and you don't mess with my people.
Let's do this
the second gratuitous violation of physics comes in this scene the force of gravity always points down but helicopter spinning blades create a force perpendicular
to the blades themselves
so if you want to hover you need to be level so the forces will cancel out and you won't move if you tilt forward
and then break the thrust force into its x and y components
you suddenly have an unbalanced force that will move you in that direction in essence
that's how helicopters move forward by tipping forward in other words
It's physically impossible to hover in an orientation like this
The forward thrust component is unbalanced and it would have to move the phone forward
The third major issue is the Arduino compatible circuit board
he chose.  It's the same board here and it's supposed to be the brains for the drone
yet, this specific model of board doesn't come with any sort of gyroscope or accelerometer.
Here's why that matters if you've ever tried,
balancing something on your hand like this you and your body we're creating what's referred to as a closed-loop feedback control system.
So if it starts to tip over my eyes relay that to my brain and my hand says hey
I'm no longer fuelling the weight just up and down
it's also pushing my hand this way and so my brain takes all that information and
responds by telling my hand to move this way at a specific speed in order to compensate.
So, to keep this thing balanced there's this continuous loop of quickly gathering information and then making real-time adjustments and closed feedback
loops are used all over in engineering from the simple case of a thermostat that
continuously checks the air and turns on at a certain temperature to
dart boards that update their position 200 times a second to get a bull's-eye every time
to machines that are abused and most certainly for anything that flies and needs to stay in the air the fact that his board is
missing a gyroscope and an accelerometer
means there's no way for it to tell if it's starting to rotate or to fall in any direction
It's the equivalent of trying to balance the board wearing a blindfold and an oven mitt
you have no idea what adjustments to make to keep things balanced.  Which is the perfect lead-in to the fourth major physics
Flaw notice how he attaches these motors and rigidly fixes them to the phone double-stick tape
this means if you start to tip forward
you have no way to self-correct the phone
orientation and it would just turn into a nosedive, if you only have two propellers in this configuration
they both need to be able to rotate with respect to the phone in order to correct the movements in all six degrees of freedom
for example if it starts to tip forward
you could rotate them both back like this
to correct for that.  Or if the wind is trying to spin the phone this way they could assume this configuration to
counter that to return to our balancing shovel analogy by fixing the motors directly to the case
you lose your ability to even make corrections
so not only do you have no idea where to move, but your arm is locked out for making adjustments anyways
which makes it literally impossible to balance.
Owwww.
My final physics issue with this video is one of acoustics
this guy proposes using it as a hands-free way to watch your favorite super hip music videos
conveniently dubbing over the audio here
for reference this is what an episode of the office would sound like on a phone at full volume
and don't forget that you would actually need 13 more motors than this so it would be at least six times louder.  [Extremely Loud Whirling Sound]
So now that we thoroughly established a multitude of physical laws have been broken.
Let's find out exactly how he faked it and to do that
I've arranged video call with the undisputed heavyweight champion of the bunking fake videos using special effects Captain disillusion
Be sure to get it as flush as possible against your skin to minimize folds that might make it hard to
chroma key out like this
nice and tight
Captain oh hi Mart Mart robber you weren't supposed to call yet. It's 2 o'clock
I'm actually even 5 minutes late, really.
Well then.
How can I help you
did you not even watch the video I sent
ah, yes, of course the mobile drone video
I've analysed that thoroughly mark and my conclusion is it's totally real
Seriously, yes
Everything except for the mobile drone part, that's fake
if you look very
closely
You might just be able to make out the huge
chattering mask on the side of the phone
Visible in every shot of it flying the creator must have been in a real hurry because it's so messy here
it cuts off the edge of the phone here the tip of his finger and here it reveals the thing
it's supposed to be hiding a rod. It's narrow and light-colored and probably attached with the same mounting tape
He used to tack on all the other gadgets
That's why he's able to grab and adjust the phone in this shot by the river the mask hides not just the stick
But the whole person holding it look closer on this site the real-time
Water and on this side a still frame from an empty version of the shot
And if we track the phone's position and rotation we can easily
Reverse-engineer exactly how the stick puppeteer did rotating mostly from the point where it was held
Wow
That was very impressive captain D
Thank you for taking the time favorite part of this whole thing is the audio
The tiny propellers must have made so little noise at a distance. It didn't give a proper drone vibe
So the hoaxers recorded the sound of the motors up close and reused the same clip in every scene
complete with their muttering voices in the background
[Whirling Noise and Muffled Voices]
Awesome well, thanks again.
But, even though impressive is the number of posts messages and tweets
Presumably from people with functioning eyeballs asking me if this painfully obvious edit is real over and over.
Okay, captain will take care. I've got to go back to my even you mark how could you do this to me?
How could you do?
He's such a joker. So let's fake and now you know
exactly all the reasons why but still a really interesting idea and I was curious what it would look like if you actually
built one of these at using less special effects and more practical engineering.
So, naturally I called in my buddy Peter Shree people whose qualifications
Include building his own electric flame from scratch and he immediately got to work.
Turns out if you take two brushless motors to electronic motor speed controllers a flight controller that actually has a gyroscope and an accelerometer
Integrated a 3d printed frame and two servos to articulate the rotors a radio
transmitter for remote control and a force the lipo battery and then you put them all together it actually works.
Kind of we had to do a bunch of test flights to calibrate that
Feedback control loop we talked about before
so if we notice the drone is either under
compensating or over compensating when it starts to fall in a certain way
we tweak the response
sensitivity in between flights until we get to the sweet spot and I should mention remember how the motors from the fake video could barely
Lift only six quarters. Well, if you properly sized them for the task at hand, they should be able to lift 150 quarters.
And so once we felt like we had it in pretty good shape. We took her out for the maiden test flight
[Music Plays]
They in our defense it was a little windy out there
but as you can see, it can be pretty wobbly at times the truth is a bike copter like this totally works
it just isn't a great design choice.
The reason pretty much all camera drones are quad copters is because they're much more stable due to a larger footprint shared between four motors
and by getting clever with the throttle speeds you can move in all six degrees of freedom with no moving parts
So there you go with solid engineering. You don't need hidden rods or masking and rotoscoping and Sir Isaac Newton can once again
comfortably rest in his grave. So, the moral of the story is just don't cheat and lie in scam
I actually considered going a little easier on Amazing Maker
but then I happen to scan some of his other videos like this knee brace that
Charges your phone and even powers this flashlight as you walk in theory
I'll skip the details
but in reality this system would also never work as shown which is why if you whine that and stabilize on his hand in the
pocket you see him click a hidden flash light switch.
[Boom]
If you want to build a flying selfie foam case yourself
you can watch the video Peter made with all the juicy details. You can find that on his channel or new website
I created called mark rover build instructions.com, and on that site and
you'll actually see build instructions for tons of different projects from my channel, which was made possible by the fine folks at wix.com
I wanted something simple and classy and I almost feel a little guilty
I can make something dysfunctional and it only took about an hour in part. Thanks to a series of questions
you answer when you get started
that means right off the bat
you're close to what you want,
but you can still customize it as much as you like from there
including lining it with one of the hundreds of templates they have and my website is just a simple way to communicate information
but you can make one for your personal brand or your
portfolio, or maybe a new website for your business to sell stuff, or even book appointments right there.  And it's free to sign up to
start designing and publishing and it's honestly a lot of fun.

Thanks for watching
so a couple months ago I took a GoPro
camera and I attached it to a spinning
ceiling fan to sort of create a ghetto
bullet time matrix effect the problem
with that is that the GoPro only shoots
at 240 frames per second so to fix that
my buddies at aim research let me borrow
their phantom high-speed camera which
shoots at up to 20,000 frames per second
the problem with that is that the camera
is just too heavy and expensive to spin
it around like we did with the GoPro so
I got with my NASA engineer buddy Ken
here and we built a crazy rig and by we
I mean mostly him so we put the camera
and a protective enclosure below a
spinning armature that has two mirrors
on it so the light from the object that
we're interested in filming bounces off
both mirrors and down into the camera
lens so it's basically like the camera
spinning around really fast at 200 rpms
even though it's perfectly safe below
and that's how you get really awesome
footage like this
and we've actually been shooting
slingshots at these things all day long
and I wasn't torn near the end of the
day that we realized there's a massive
propane tank right behind uh yeah
basically where we're shooting but
nobody died so so my buddy Destin from
smarter every day actually helped out
with the rig and he made a video about
the importance of all the failures we
encountered or trying to build it cuz
they were a lot alright alright so first
off should go check it out you can also
check out some of my other videos like
how to make a delicious smoothie with a
drill and a coat hanger or how to
totally dominate your ugly Christmas
sweater party with out even trying that
hard and finally if you need to run a
high-speed camera Nathan at a research
will take care of you including sending
an operator with the camera if needs be
they are awesome to work with and best
of all they are way way more affordable
than anything else I could find out

Yeeeee (camara flash)
Joseph   Are amazing   Man Conner Coat.
science was visiting the LA children
museum and having my shadow captured on
the wall so as a tribute to that moment
i'm going to show you how to build your
own shower wall and then we're going to
talk about the science behind what makes
up actually glow and then we take it to
the next level with the ridiculously
talented artist buddy of mine but first
i wanted to see if kids said that you
think these four walls are as cool as I
once did so we invited some family
friends over for a party
Chris
you
when the dads came in the results were
as expected
you
Oh
Sears how you make it for projecting the
light standard camera flash works great
the higher the LA to the bed or you
could sort of paint it with like UV
flashlights or this blue laser a red
laser doesn't work Anna normal
flashlight doesn't work as well either
and will there quiet a second for the
wall I only were two options easy to use
glow-in-the-dark paint or I found a
place online that sells rules of
glow-in-the-dark vinyl sheets you can
put it directly on the wall ribosome
half inch ear off just to make it pork
and depending on how much is the wall
you want to cover probably cost you
somewhere between 50 it may be 200 bucks
I put all the links in the description
with even more details so I asked my
super talented friend Jason balding to
come over and see what he could do with
the global but before we get to that
let's quickly thought about the science
behind why sub close our eyes can
actually see electromagnetic waves from
400 to 700 nanometers in length and our
brain distinguishes them as colors so
400 is ooh and then up to 700 a meters
is red as soon as a wavelength gets
asked this band we can't see it anymore
and on the short-wavelength side we have
ultraviolet or UV and on the longer
wavelengths side we have infrared or IR
they can keep going on the shorter
wavelength side eventually you get
things like x-rays you keep going on a
long wavelength side eventually
like Wi-Fi and even radio waves which
could be the length of entire cities
when you look at fluorescent colors
something special is happening electrons
and fluorescent materials get excited to
a higher energy state by ultraviolet
light that we can't see and then when
they return to their low energy state
they have a visible light that we can
see this is why they seem to glow in the
Sun or under a blacklight invisible UV
light comes in and then visible light
comes out which is why they seem
brighter more light is actually hitting
your eyes that if they weren't floor apt
glow in the dark stuff is just a special
case of fluorescence called
phosphorescence the only difference is
that instead of electrons can be excited
and then releasing that energy right
away phosphorescent materials have
electrons that get excited but then we
get trapped in this high energy state
and it takes them a while I release the
energy and get back to their original
state and he'll get back the same total
light it's just over a long period of
time which is why they glow dip okay
nowadays
we also found that if you displayed an
image with a projector you could burn
that image into the wall and if you just
let it on your phone you can sort of
make a light stand
a few months back I made a video about
the scale of the solar system using just
a drone and then just junk you find
lying around your house for scale and
you might have noticed that I didn't
include poor Pluto but I did include a
new ninth planet that has been
discovered with math that is ten times
more massive than Earth and it's super
far away so the guy who was responsible
for getting Pluto kicked out also
happens to be the same dude who
discovered this new ninth planet a few
years later his name is Mike Brown and
he is a Caltech astronomer and he also
happens to be super brilliant and really
funny he wrote a book called how I
killed Pluto and Wyatt had it coming and
it's the best book I've read in the past
three years and I power through two
three books a month and I know a book
about astronomy seems kind of lame but
trust me on this it's just one of those
that changes the way you think about
things and see the nice guy so the good
folks inaudible who are kind enough to
support this channel have made it so
that if you want to listen to Mike's
book or any other book for free all you
have to do is use the link of the
description or go to audible.com slash
mark Rover thanks for watching
Oh
that's just
yes
Oh
so the other day I was at the zoo with
my family and we saw these people just
banging on the monkey exhibit trying to
eat the monkeys attention and the
monkeys couldn't have been less
interested and I thought since they're
probably tired of looking at his dumb
humans all day I wonder if they just
prefer to see themselves so I took out
my phone switch to the front-facing
camera so the monkeys could see
themselves and hit record and they
thought it was pretty cool
on the phone obviously the camera and
the screen can't be on top of each other
so sometimes the monkey would go off
camera when he came up to get a closer
look to fix that I went to the hardware
store got a mirror for three bucks and
drilled a hole right in the center of
some carbide tip drill bits to put the
camera in the back so now if a grill is
looking at his reflection the camera is
right in the center of that image so he
took this newly pimped out eight dollar
gorilla cam went back to the zoo went
straight to the grill exhibit and what
you're seeing here is exactly what
happened is that how did he do that
that's cool
after a few minutes the mom grabbed the
baby and they kind of came over to check
things out now according to research
this is pretty much the cutest thing
possible actually this is the cutest
thing possible but this is a very close
second once mom and baby walked away it
was dad's turn to check out his rugged
good looks it was just a cool experience
I shot all this crazy footage in like
four minutes with a crappy camera phone
and it cost me eight bucks on this final
shot if you look close you can even see
its pupil dilating flawless got me
thinking and it turns out this trick
kind of works on higher order primates
just as well
I've got four or five more videos in the
work so if you like creative junk like
this ya best be subscribed
two years ago I made a Halloween costume
using two iPads and a FaceTime chat to
blow a hole through my stomach so people
really seem to like that costume so the
next year this was my design the Mars
rover and for Halloween mark burber has
created something else out of this world
so basically the way it works is you
download a free app called digital duds
and play an animation for your costume
then you would match it up with the
corresponding shirt that had a hole in
it and that video did even better than
the first one so for this year August in
the next two minutes going through 17
awesome costume ideas so you know that's
true your Halloween party looking like
this okay for starters last year you had
to cut the hole in the shirt and duct
tape your mobile device to the back but
this year all the digital duct shirts
come with a secure pocket that can hold
any size Apple or Android mobile device
so we kept all the best designs from
last year including of course my
favorite the friggin Haunted Mansion
picture frame like from scooby-doo but
we also added some really cool new
designs as well we've also totally
redesigned the iWay now I can fit any
size mobile device and you just slip it
over your head and you put on your
favorite shirt or take you to the next
level with a little bit of red paint we
also have the really cool zipper I would
because I genuinely love creating stuff
like this three months ago I actually
quit my job at NASA as a result I was
able to work with my buddy Jeremy on
taking some of the animations this year
like this one straight to expert mode so
you show up to the party like this and
then your buddy
[Music]
sticks his hand through your back like
this so it's really cool about that is
it's actually activated by the
accelerometer in your mobile device so
as soon as your buddy touches your back
and you press your chest forward the
animation plays and as my buddy rahat
shows here people become uncomfortable
when they see you're reading art so I
also teamed up this year with the guys
to make more suits and we made some
really cool designs like this beating
heart muscle suit we also came up with a
way to make super high-resolution prints
so you get really freaky things like
this this or this and everybody loves
clowns this just be careful your honor
it apart because random people might not
understand so this year's spent 30
seconds prepping your costume is still
dominate the party like it's no big deal
and jeans and a t-shirt or go with any
one of these awesome ideas just not this
one
hey what's that or what's a banana doing
eating an apple this should be a banana
what so finally one awesome and totally
free idea is to play the eyeball video
from the app on to iPads and then put
them in some windows in your house on a
Halloween night or put them in the back
window of your car to watch the other
drivers freak out so you can get access
to any of these costumes plus a bunch
more really cool inside any show either
through
or at digital debts calm also you check
out the video description to see if
there's a store near you that actually
carries that so that's it for this year
I hope you guys have a safe Halloween
now go dominate your party
[Music]
so for the past thirty years pretty much
everything related to technology has
become more awesome from computers to
cars to toys but I feel like a glaring
exception to this rule is the humble
microwave which is pretty much remained
unchanged since its inception in 1967
and that's a shame because there are
quite a few sucky things about it for
example it's really hard to guess the
cooking time on a frozen burrito and it
takes several trips of the microwave and
a couple of incisions before it's
finally unfrozen conversely if you cook
your hot pocket for 30 seconds too many
it becomes a hot lava pocket basically
unless you stop the microwave and pull
your food out to inspect it there's no
way to tell if it's done just right so
as humans we were like primarily on our
sense of sight so it would be so much
better if we could be like the predator
and just glance over and see the
temperature of our food to tell if it
was done and the amazing news is that is
possible now infrared cameras can
basically see the temperature of things
and they cost like a thousand times less
than they did ten years ago they even
comes like phone attachments now so if
your microwave were to have an infrared
lens attached right in the top sort of
like this you put the food in to start
cooking and then the front of the
microwave becomes the screen to display
the heat map so it will start as blue
because it's cold but then as it cooks
it will work its way to the temperature
scale eventually to red and then all
white when it's done it's really simple
in fact your microwave TV program so
that when the thing you're cooking
becomes all white it automatically shuts
off and it gets even better because you
could pass that heat map via Bluetooth
or Wi-Fi to your phone so you can put
your soup in and then you can work
upstairs and if you don't see all white
after four minutes you can just add
another 30 seconds to cook time from
your phone without having to go back
downstairs and check on things so
there's a bunch more things you could do
too like using the LCD you've got now to
display recipes or play cooking videos
so I've actually been working on this
nights and weekends for the past year
and I have a prototype of
I also had an extensive patent search
done on this and nobody had a patent on
the concept so I got one I've seen way
too many butts on Kickstarter projects
to sit here and ask you for money so
investors of money are there they just
need to know people would actually want
this say for keeping an eye on round 2
of your bacon cooking while you sit on
the couch and enjoy the savory fruits of
round 1 so if you want to help bring
some innovation to the Forgotten
microwave or you want one for yourself
instead of your money I would love for
two things
so first sign a petition saying this is
totally something you would buy if it
were priced right so we can show that
there's demand you can find that
petition at better microwave comm or the
link in the description or by clicking
here and number 2 if you know someone
that's really into gadgets or techy
stuff or couch sitting bacon cooking
send them this video and now if you'll
excuse me I have some perfectly cooked
bacon that requires my attention so the
theme of this video sort of invention
and innovation my personal heroes on
this topic are Steve Jobs and Apple's
industrial design genius Johnny I've I
recently just listened to both of their
biographies and it was fascinating to me
to see just how differently they viewed
the world so if you want to listen to
either these biographies or any other
book for free audible has stepped up and
offered to support the development of
the microwave all you do is use the link

slash mark rover seriously if you have
any sort of commute at all and you've
never tried an audiobook you just have
to try it out it makes crowded subways
and traffic actually enjoyable
personally I listen to them all the time
and I've always used audible just
because they have the best selection and
it syncs with all my devices thank you
for watching the video that's around
So, Here today, in my house
with my buddy Robert
but as a fair warning,
this video is a slight departure
from my usual sciency build stuff.
But I've wanted to make it for a really long time,
so I hope you guys enjoy it.
It's basically an epic Hot Wheels race between
the A-Team van,
the Night Rider,
the Ghostbusters wagon,
the Delorean from Back to the Future,
and the Scooby Doo Mystery Machine.
So place your bets in the comments below
and let's see who wins!
Robert actually made a behind the scenes video
if you're curious how we got some of these shots.
I actually learned a ton about how to be a real filmmaker
by working with him,
so go check that out because his channel is awesome.
I also want to thank the cool people at 23Andme
for their support on this video.
These guys are a huge part of the story of where
the future of medicine is headed.
They analyse your actual DNA,
in your actual chromosomes,
hence the name 23andme because humans have
23 chromosomes,
and then they tell you things about your actual ancestry,
health, and traits.
And the way it works is super simple,
they send you this box in the mail,
then you spit in this tube in the box,
and then you send it back in the mail,
and in a few weeks you get your report back.
So I actually did this, and I got the results back,
but I haven't seen them yet because
I'm waiting to view them for a future video I'm working on.

Thanks for watching.
I was at a football game recently sitting towards the top like this.
And I found myself clapping and I thought 'Wait, does this even matter? Like can they even hear a clap
from way dow there on the field?'
if our goal as fans much noise as possible, what is the
scientifically proven the best way to do that?
Do you stomp or yell, and should you
yell be high-pitched or low pitch? Does
cupping your hands make a difference?
What about one of these? Or this? Or one
of these? And should the cheering at the
change depending on where your seats are?
I had some guesses, so as a firm believer
in the scientific method, I decided to
test my hypothesis.
So I've got a control
group of three fans- AHAHAH. It's some real nice
audio equipment, so they are going to
sit in a bunch of different seats all
over the stadium and cheer in all the
different possible ways and then we're
gonna analyze which cheers are the
loudest from down here on the field.
But first I needed a baseline to compare our
cheering too. And since I attended grad
school at USC, they let me come back to
the Coliseum to take some measurements.
And while everyone else was enjoying the game,
I was dutifully collecting audio data.
Mostly.
So now that I've got my baseline for the
full stadium, I think it's time to do our
experiment in the empty stadium. You guys ready?
YEEAAHHHH!!!!
So our fans stood in 12 different
locations throughout the stadium, and in
each location they cycle through the same 11 cheers.
And then me my buddy Marcelo,
who happens to have a PhD in
acoustics, stood at center field and
recorded the data.
Ok so we're finished
and we're currently processing the data.
But before we state the results, I think
it's important to review the science
behind how hearing works.
Your eardrums are
fancy biological sensors that tell
you if anything is pushing on them.
It's like if you blow on the back of your
hand, you can feel the pressure from the
blown air only your eardrums are
millions of times more sensitive than that.
So these guys represent individual
air molecules. And when you hear that
lovely bird chirping, what's actually
happening is the birds throat is moving
and it pushes the air molecules right
next to it. Which pushes the molecules
next to it and causes a chain reaction
called a longitudinal wave. And those
crashes keep happening until they crash
into the air molecules in your ear canal,
which then crash into your eardrum,
causing it to move just a little.
And depending on
the pattern of
movement from the repeated crashes, your
brain is like, "oh I recognize that as a
bird chirp." And if the molecules are
crashing it at a high frequency we hear
that as a high pitch, and if they're
crashing it is a low frequency, we hear
that as a low pitch. And the greater
distance your eardrum gets pushed in, our
brain registers that as a loud sound. Okay,
now for the results.
For starters here is the baselines for the loudest sounds
I recorded at the actual game.
And then for comparison we took the recorded sound
measurements from our three fans, and
scaled them up. So this is how loud it
would be if all 94 thousand people in
the Coliseum were clapping at once. Not
surprisingly clapping is in last place
as far as loudness of all the cheers go.
Next up in 8th place are these
ThunderStick things. They look sort of
obnoxious, but they're not actually that loud.
And now in seventh we have
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
booing. Which was a bit surprising to me
it was so low in the rankings. And as you
can see we are now louder than the max
sounds I recorded at the game. And this
makes sense, because you never actually
have all 94 thousand people cheering at
the same time. Which raises sort of an
obvious observation which is that sound
is cumulative. So you want to make sure
everybody is pitching in. Next up we have
a tie for fifth place between the
cowbell and the boo-boos. And this was
again a surprise to me because I
remember the constant drone
from all of the vuvuzelas from the 2010
world cup. But when we were standing at
center field, we definitely agreed it
wasn't as loud as some of the other
cheering. I think they're just really easy
for one person to make a long sustained
noise with, and so when you have a couple
thousand people with them you get this
constant drone, but it's not actually
that loud of the human ear which brings
up a good point we are measuring
loudness here, and not the typical sound
pressure or decibel. Decibels aren't
actually that great for measuring how a
human ear perceives sound, because of the
constant decibel level we actually
perceive certain frequencies as louder
than others. Loudness accounts for that.
So it's a better measurement of what you
would actually here down here on the field.
Additionally, the loudness scale is
linear. So if you double the loudness,
that would mean in real life it would
seem twice as loud. And in third place, we
have another tie between screaming at
the top of your lungs without a cone or
cupping in your hands, and screaming at the
top of your lungs with cupping your
hands or using a cone. And this seemed
counter-intuitive at first, until we
notice the effect of the cone was only
slightly more pronounced when you were
really close to the field. So the further
from the field you are, the less of a
difference it makes. Because as soon as
your voice leaves the cone, the pressure
wave propagates in all directions. So
it's diffused by the time it hits the
field either way. It is encouraging
though that from the perspective of the
players on the field yelling at the top
of your lungs is more effective than all
this other stuff. Okay so to set the
stage for the first and second loudest
cheer, remember that in a sport like
American football your goal as a fan is
to make so much noise that the players
eardrums are moving in and out so much
that they can't sense the smaller
eardrum movements of the snap count.
And so they fall start and get a penalty.
This is why the Seahawks recently
held the world record for the loudest stadium.
And also have the most false start
penalties by a comfortable margin.
Which means the fans are directly affecting
the outcome of the game.
And so finally, sort of not surprisingly, in first place
we have the air horn. But a very close
second place, was one of these weird things.
It's sort of like a kazoo on steroids.
It's nearly as loud as an air horn,
but it's small and discreet.
And it's powered by your own lungs.
Very few sporting leagues have explicit rules
against noise makers, because they're
hard to enforce. And so I'm not
advocating this, but I'll simply point
out that these things are really cheap,
and a student section could pitch in and
get a thousand of these things for about
a hundred bucks online.

So that, cold art science fun on cheering. But it's thorough
man of science we knew there was one
final scenario we needed a test, for all
those watching the game at home.
OH COME ON!!!!!!!

Sorry.
Wait, you spelled "subscribing" wrong.
I want to quickly
Audible for sponsoring this video.
One of the most notable USC alumni was a guy
named Louie Zamperini. He was sort of an
accidental olympian who ended up serving
in World War II. Where his plane went
down in the ocean, most died in the crash.
But he survived and they ended up living
off raw fish and stray birds for over a
month. With like sharks circling and
jumping in their raft. Eventually, he's
captured by the Japanese and put in a
concentration camp and it just gets
worse from there. It's an unbelievable
true story, which makes it one of the
most inspirational books I've ever
listened to. So if you want to listen to

And...
There we are.
So I am blown away that as of this moment,
it now requires seven digits to describe how many of you guys
care about the dumb videos that I make every month.
And I suck at saying words for things like this.
So I decided I would say thank you in the best way that I know how.
Which is what I do every month through the medium of video editing.
So my YouTube journey and ultimately how I met you
started randomly when I asked my wife to film my Halloween costume.
And that split-second decision completely changed our lives.
Here's an idea for a really simple Halloween costume
So basically, white shirt, cut a hole in the front
hole in the back...
Tonight I've invited a very crafty individual to help us.
His name is Mark Rober. He used to work for NASA.
Now he has his own YouTube channel

ROOWR
Now that summer is winding down and you've already spent lots of time in the water,
I want to show you now how to figure out how much pee is in any pool.
There's actually a lot of misinformation on the topic of pee and pools,
so I'm gonna do some experiments on my own along with some clever science people in foreign lands and spoiler alert:
some of the results are good news and some aren't, so let's jump right in.
So this first experiment is to determine how much pee is in an actual sample of pool water using an ingenious method.
So I got two samples from my friend's community pool, where lots of people swim.  One from the pool and one from the Spa, and
Then two samples from a friend's backyard, again one from the pool and one from the Spa.
I also collected samples from the source water at each location as a control and I'll explain why in a minute.
Now that I have my samples I needed to quickly get to my scientist friend Lindsay in Canada, but lucky for me--
--I knew a shortcut.
We are now in the lab
of the University of Alberta, and this is Lindsay Blackstock and she is basically a genius.
So you are going to help me determine
how much pee is in these samples, because we know people pee in the pool.
Yes, we have strong evidence that people do pee in the pool
So we're going to try to find a way that we can measure that pee without actually measuring pee.
I'm going to apply my new strategy based on the amount of artificial sweetener that's in the pool. We know artificial sweeteners
don't come from anywhere
except for urine, so that's the only logical source for them if we find them in the pool,
and we know how much artificial sweetener is in the average
person's pee and then using that we can estimate how much pee is in the pool, so we're going to take this sample,
we're going to bring it over to our sample prep bench, we're going to filter it, transfer it into some special vials
Into this instrument, which is a
liquid chromatography system, so this instrument is going to concentrate our
sample before it passes it on over to the second instrument,
which is a mass spectrometer and the mass spectrometer is able to detect the individual little
artificial sweetener molecules one by one.
Love it, let's get to work!
Bring it on over there.
Before we run the samples let me explain why I find Lindsay the scientist's solutions, so brilliant.
You can actually take a sample of pool water and directly measure the amount of urea in there,
but the problem with that is humans also excrete urea through things like sweat,
which is also very common in a pool, so you can't tell how much of that urea actually came from pee.
To get around that she looked at the amount of a certain artificial sweetener in the sample called Acesulfame Potassium,
Which is really common in food products such as these--oh, and also all of these.
So pretty much everything.  The reason drinks like these are zero calories is because you taste the Acesulfame Potassium sweetener,
but the chemical compounds aren't broken down at all by your body so more than 99 percent is passed through in your pee,
within 24 hours.
And therefore the only reason this would be in the pool is if it passed through a person first.  And just to be sure you measure the
source water at both locations because sometimes trace amounts of the sweetener can be found in the water supply if so
we just subtract that from the results. 
 And I love this because we've all wondered
how much pee is in a specific pool?
But Lindsay figured out a really clever way to use proven science to actually answer the question.
The mass spectrometer takes about an hour to get results,
So while we were waiting,
Lindsay told me something that really surprised me.  Chlorine in pools is obviously really helpful because it breaks down harmful bacteria,
viruses, and microbes that would be harmful or even potentially deadly to humans.
However, there is one big downside and that is, it reacts with urine to create a byproduct called trichloramine
So trichloramine is what's responsible for that chlorine smell?
That you might get when you enter into an indoor swimming facility
It's also- but if you smell chlorine like straight out the bottle, it has that chlorine smell.
Yeah, but but the smell that you smell in a pool is trichloramine, like this is the compound responsible for that
characteristic swimming pool smell- if I look skeptical here
it's only because I was; so I devised an experiment of my own
to see if this is really true.  For the experiment I got two five-gallon buckets and filled them with pure water,
then I added four times the recommended concentration of chlorine for that volume of water to both buckets,
and then only in the bucket labeled B
I added just a little bit of pee, and I let it sit for a couple days.  Alright, so it's been three days,
so this is the moment of truth
So the first thing I notice is
visually, they look the same.  You can't tell one bucket from the other as far as color of water goes.
So I'm gonna start and smell this one first
Mmm, so that doesn't smell like anything, that smells just like water even though this has four times the recommended concentration of chlorine for this
volume which makes me nervous to smell this one.
What?
That is crazy!
This smells like a pool even though the only difference between these two
is this has a little bit of pee in it. This is a nostalgic smell this smells like
summers and vacationing at hotels of pools and water parks,
Turns out it was just pee.  So in if trichloramine which again is what is produced when pee reacts with chlorine,
was just that classic pool smell that's not that big of a deal,
but the problem is it's kind of bad news for both your lungs and your eyes.
When your eyes are really red after swimming for a while, that's actually because of the trichloramine from the pee,
not the chlorine.  Trichloramine also causes things like asthma.  In fact studies show
asthma is more likely to occur among elite swimmers, than any other high-level athlete, which now makes sense because
Michael Phelps admitted to always peeing in the pool, and he says all his buddies do too.
So be cool, and don't pee in the pool. Now let's go see Lindsay's results.  In Lindsay's research
She sampled 20 public swimming pools and 10 public hot tubs.  The average concentration of sweetener for the pools was
470 nanograms per liter and for the hot tubs was 2,247.
So after running all of my samples we found that here in my friend's backyard pool,
they had a concentration of artificial sweetener of 69 nano grams per liter which equates to just under a gallon of pee.
Which is actually much lower than the average,
but that makes sense because this would see much less use than a public pool.  Their spa had a higher concentration in the pool at
103 but since the spa contains much less volume,
That equates to about this much pee. 
 So far not bad, and then in this public community pool
We had 27 nano grams per liter of artificial sweetener
concentration which for this volume is again a little bit less than a gallon and the spa is higher at a concentration of
335 which is about this much for the volume of spa
so the concentration of artificial sweetener in this pool and spa is much much lower
than the averages Lindsay saw in the 30 samples
she collected, which leads me to believe that the water has been completely replaced
recently which happens from time to time for various reasons. If this pool has the average
concentrations reported by Lindsay, for these volumes we would expect to see over a gallon of pee in the hot tub and about
13 gallons in the pool.  If you want an estimate of the pee in your own pool, I came up with a simple equation after
talking with professor Ernest Blatchley of Purdue University,
who mentioned that studies have found that swimmers introduced between 25 and 80 milliliters of urine per swim session.
So you take the average number of swimmers that were in your pool per day during the summer, and then you multiply that by 1.2.
That's how many gallons of pee are in your pool at the end of the summer and if you think your friends and neighbors pee
more than average use 2 as the multiplier and if you think they are more on the courteous side of the range,
use 1/2 as the multiplier.  As a general rule of thumb, though public pools about this size will contain
approximately 13 gallons of pee and Olympic pools will contain- brace yourself
Over 130 Gallons. There are some caveats to these generalizations so check out the links in the video description
for published papers for both scientists Lindsay and professor Blatchley.
So in conclusion, what does this all mean?
Like is this something to be grossed out about?  For starters
let me just say pee is generally considered to be sterile meaning it's free from bacteria
and any living things. You can totally drink this stuff and not get sick.  In fact in some cultures
that's totally a thing.
"You drink the grandsons pee, and it's going to help you"
additionally urine is made of
95% water and just 5%
of dissolved solids like the urea stuff we've been talking about.  The fact that pee is so diluted at 95% pure water is in part,
disappointingly why it's really hard to make a chemical you could add to any pool that will magically turn blue if someone pees in it.
Having said that I suppose
It's still a little gross knowing you're swimming in even just a small amount of pee, but I feel all the benefits to your happiness and well-being
that can come from swimming, far outweigh
any sort of gross factor or minor health risks. I guess at the end of the day my advice would be to be cool
and don't pee in the pool and then at that point-
Just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming swimming swimming
Just maybe take a shower when you're done
Speaking of swimming pools, did you know your heart pumps enough blood to fill 4 Olympic sized swimming pools every year, or how about that
there's a hundred lightning strikes on Earth every second, or did you know that it's so hard or something become a fossil
that if all humans currently living right now suddenly went extinct we would only leave behind 8
skeletons as fossils somewhere buried in the Earth.  Now if you would have listened to "A Short History of Nearly
Everything" on Audible like me, you would have known all of that.
This book is a really entertaining synopsis of all the stuff that we know about
science, including when and how we learned it.  In addition to talking about all the stuff we don't have answers for you.
I really liked it and it's a big book
But if you use audible and listen to 1.25 speed like I do while your commuting to and from work,
you could knock this out in a little over week.
So if you wanna listen to a short history of nearly everything or any other audio book for free, all you have to do is
use the link in the description, or go to audible.com/MarkRober. Thanks for watching!
"Just keep swimming, just keep swimming swimming swimming"
We look at the back, those are the egg sacks.
Dude!!!!
I was not kidding.
Oh my god.
So this might be...
I'm holding in my hand a microscope that is waterproof, stomp proof.
I put it together in 2 minutes and it costs 50 cents to make.
And in this hand I have a blood centrifuge
that spins 10 times faster than a 10,000 dollar centrifuge and it costs 18 cents.
Both of these were invented here at Stanford in the lab of a brilliant physicist, biologist, inventor named Manu Prakash,
with the goal to help improve the life of the world's poorest, through low cost, effective, scalable inventions.
Incredibly it's believed that of the estimated 100 billion people to have lived on this planet,
More than half have died of malaria.
The symptoms are similar to the flu, and so the goal standard for diagnoses is to take a drop of blood,
spin it in a centrifuge and then look at under a microscope.
Historically, this has been really hard to do in the places that need it the most,
because the equipment can cost tens of thousands of dollars and it needs electricity
These two inventions can diagnose malaria, cost less than a dollar and require no electricity.
Manu, good to finally meet you.
Absolutely
You're like a superhero
Oh I don't know about that.
From an engineering perspective what you do is amazing.
Now before I continue with Manu,
let me just support that statement by showing how this 50 cent paper microscope actually works.
So it comes like this and you pop out the pieces of paper,
and follow the simple instructions like folding origami.
The lens is actually a tiny sphere of glass embedded in this plastic.
Then you put your slide in here,
and then you look through that tiny glass sphere and it's magnified 140x.
You can even put your phone up to it and film and then capture a video like this.
Your lab at Stanford, what do you do? What's your missions? Like the high level.
I grew up in India and one of the things I've always enjoyed is
getting exposed to scientific tools.
When I started the lab it was very clear that we have this hunger for scientific tools that's missing.
And so we spent almost 50% of our time building and designing scientific tools,
under the umbrella of "frugal science"
It can't cost a ton of money because every zero that you add
to a scientific movement probably hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of people cut off.
I wanted to test drive this paper microscope so we got a scoop of seemingly clear water from this pond,
and there was one tiny white spec that didn't settle to the bottom of our bag.
So Manu suggested that we take a closer look.
They can sense suction.
Ah, okay.
And they run away.
It's kind of like a fly when you'r trying to swat it, it senses your hand before it comes.
And that's what's actually happening, it realizes -you know- just like it's about to go in a mouth of a fish.
It runs away, but I think I'm gonna get it.
Got it.
There it is.
LAUGHS
Okay
Oh there he is.
He's in this one.
And remember, to the naked eye you can barely see this tiny
white spec.
Woah!
That's the single eye, you see that?
That little spot right there, and then we look
And then we look at the back
those are the egg sacks.
Dude!!
I was not kidding, so this might be 10-15 eggs on each side.
Those are antenna.
So when I said when I was sucking it in and it ran away.
It senses the pressure variation through those.
That's so crazy
You know this reminds me of like the first
time I saw the stars with the telescope.
Right? So you can see the stars all the
time and you see the pictures of the
stars but until you actually see it
yourself in a telescope it's just
like something shifts inside you and I
feel like we're doing the same thing but
just the other way.
I think that's such a beautiful analogy.
So with this 50 cent paper microscope you can actually see
any malaria in your blood. We generally
think of blood as a red liquid but it's
actually full of particles like red blood
cells, white blood cells and platelets.
So the problem is in just a couple drops of
blood you have a billion red blood cells.
So becomes the needle in a haystack,
trying to find a few that have malaria. So
that's where centrifuge comes in.
So you take some blood and put it in a tube and particles
will be all mixed up like this, but when
you spin it around really fast for a
couple minutes
the centrifugal force pushes all the
heaviest particles to the outside and
they displace the less dense particles
towards the middle. So when you stop, all
the particles are neatly organized from
the most dense at the edge to the least dense
in the center and since the malaria
effected red blood cell is slightly less
dense than a healthy one, you'll always
find it in between the healthy red blood
cells and the clear plasma. All that's to
say centrifuges are really critical
So I went to the lab to talk to Manu's colleague Saad.
to see how they apply their
frugal science philosophy to this
typically really expensive piece of
equipment.
These are traditional centrifuges. These
require electricity and you can see how
massive that is.
Imagine if you have to carry this on
your back if you're in a resource-limited
setting in India, for example, where I
grew up. And so if you want to do this, you
can't use something like this which costs
thousands of dollars and requires
electricity, and so while we were out
there we had a Foldscope but you
couldn't just take blood or urine or
stool and do it. That became the bottlenecking.
For the design problem statement
that you come up with is I want something
probably less than a dollar, preferably
made out of lightweight materials like
paper so it is easy to carry in your pocket,
it should match the speed of these devices.
You think about different gears and
mechanisms and you go into your kitchen
and your backyard and start thinking
about toys, toys are a great way. So we started
looking at yo-yos egg beaters and others
have thought about salad spinners. What
we found in this whirligig toy
is that it's one of the
most efficient ways of converting your
energy into rotational energy and
that was the "aha" moment. Using
strings as actuation in the
middle rather than mechanical gears.
I was just trying this out as soon as I saw
that, in 10 seconds
you kind of know in the back of your
mind that this is something powerful
like, you know, it transitions beyond a toy
to something that has really important
applications in global health.
Let's recreate that moment. We're going to take
some blood and let's just spin it .
We should take your blood. All right, haha
So for spinning only for 10 seconds at
20,000 rpm you can see my blood was
already separating.
This is my own blood
I've never seen my blood at this level before.
All right, here we go
That is crazy!
So each one of those is a blood cell.
What I loved most about Manu and Saad is their childlike fascination
and curiosity about the world around them.
They're also incredibly observant,
looking for ways their engineering
talents might uniquely help or inspire
others.
It's a contagious optimism and it's
refreshing.
So I want to thank Bill and Melinda Gates
for teaming up with me on this video.
If you want to learn more about how life
has and will continue to improve for the
world's poorest check out the Bill and
Melinda Gates annual letter, I will leave a link
to it in the video description. It's a
fascinating read and you get a sense of
some of their ambitious goals,
such as a future with zero cases of diseases such as
Malaria, Polio and TB. If you watch the news,
it may seem like the world is becoming a
suckier place but the truth is
both poverty rates and childhood death rates
for the world's poorest have absolutely
plummeted in the last 15 years and this
is due in part to folks like Manu
those that support them. Thanks for watching.
The two examples of this are
This is I am awake! Yes!
It's too early morning for me.
That's your alarm clock.
That is my alarm, yeah.
In an extreme case if it's 9am and I'm still not up.
I've always thought if we could somehow
just see the germs around us everyone
would be a lot more careful and we get
sick way less unfortunately that's still
not possible so I did the next best
thing by running a day-long experiment
in this third grade classroom I found
this powder called Glo germ and just
like real germs when it's on your hands
you can't see it but unlike real germs
if you turn a black light on it becomes
visible but it transfers to things
you've touched so provides a really good
way to visualize exactly how germs
spread so before the kids arrived as a
control I went around and noted any
pre-existing spots in the room that
fluoresced under the blacklight and then
it was go time because of course had no
idea what we were doing and that the
teacher had been secretly infected with
the glowing powder so she randomly shook
the hands of three kids but didn't touch
any of the rest and so with that they
just went about their normal day at
break I did choose one random student
and he agreed to let me put some of the
powder on his hands too and then two
hours later at lunchtime I checked the
results remember everything you see here
started with just the teacher and one
student having a little of that powder
on their hands and because my flashlight
can only illuminate one spot at a time I
use Photoshop to better visualize our
observations of where germs were left
behind
including on the other kids and they
were actually pretty diligent about
washing their hands
this was the desk of the kid that was
infected and what's crazy is that germs
could live on a hard surface like this
for up to nine days and so you can see
how important it is to disinfect the
things a sick person regularly touches
for example this was the phone of the
teacher in the experiment even if you
wash your hands really often if you
immediately pull out your phone a lot of
those germs just go right back on your
hands think about when the last time was
that you cleaned your phone
my friend Joanne at The Wall Street
Journal recently demonstrated you can
clean your phone with an antibacterial
wipe every day for at least a year and
it doesn't affect the oleophobic coating
at all and this hopefully gives you a
better mental model of why it's really
important to wash your hands or use hand
sanitizer after being at places like
this or this
or this or this cleaning commonly touch
services is important because even if a
virus is spread through airborne
transmission those tiny droplets don't
stay in the air for long then they land
on surfaces waiting to be touched by our
hands which raises an important point
the ultimate defence against catching a
virus is just don't touch your face your
eyes nose and mouth are like the single
weak spot on the Death Star when it
comes to viruses that's the only way
they can get in to infect you but as you
can see here not touching your face is
easier said than done and before you
think yeah well that's just kids for you
this was what the teachers face look
like at the end of the day and she said
she tried extra hard to remember not to
touch her face
I found this result fascinating so I put
the powder on my own hands for a few
hours and I resisted the urge to touch
my face so many times that I fully
expected I was going to have a perfectly
clean face and the moral high ground and
then this is what I saw I genuinely have
no idea when any of this came on until I
reviewed the footage Wow well there you
go
on average we touch our face 16 times an
hour which is why washing hands is so
important it's impossible to catch a
virus directly through your hands it's
as futile as shooting the outer surface
of the Death Star the problem is we use
our hands to help the virus out by
constantly giving it a ride to our
figurative Deathstar exhaust ports
because of this I ran another experiment
with some of the kids after lunch first
I had them put some lotion on their
hands that also glows under a blacklight
but then I told them I made a mistake
and use the wrong lotion can you guys
just wash go wash your hands real quick
I do a good washing right yeah do the
right washing okay I just tricked you
guys again because what I really wanted
to do is test how good you are at
washing your hands so guess what I'm
gonna do now show me your hands but
before I show you how effective they
actually were at washing their hands
here's what you should quickly know
about viruses they are super tiny but
also the most abundant biological entity
on the planet in fact there's over 10
million viruses in any single drop of
seawater and a lot of types of viruses
are beneficial to the planet's ecosystem
and only an insanely tiny percentage
affect humans at all and they're really
simple
viruses are basically a shell with some
DNA inside and they just want to spread
and duplicate that's their only goal but
they're so simple that they need a host
to do that so they reproduce by
infecting their host cells and then
trick them to become factories that just
make more exact copies of the virus when
you get sick and then cough or sneeze or
wipe your nose and then touch a surface
you're putting copies of this virus out
to find other hosts and just repeat the
process and so here's what the kids
hands look like after washing their
hands we'll sort of have a habitual way
of washing our hands so once again I
tried this myself using the typical
quick way I do it in my muscle memory
granted that's better than nothing but
you could see the difference compared to
when I was deliberate and took 20
seconds which is why it helps to do
things like sing the Happy Birthday song
twice or you could do what I do and
follow Brandon Flowers example and then
for a final experiment I wanted to show
how dumb hand shaking is so I infected
the first kid with the powder and then
had them do a handshake chain down the
line the fifth person here still had
significant traces on their
and so I put him at the first in line
for more kids up after him and three of
their hands glowed so we got trace germs
from the original person all the way
down eight handshakes later so if you
ever meet me in real life please don't
be offended if in lieu of a handshake I
offer you a fist bump and a selfie in
conclusion what does this all mean with
regards to the corona virus Cova 19 you
should be concerned to take this
seriously but regardless of what you see
in the coming weeks there's absolutely
no need to panic as I'm sure you've
heard a bunch by now our goal is to
flatten the curve so the reported cases
stay just under the capacity of the
healthcare system and social distancing
is the best knob that we can turn to
affect that the reason this helps should
hopefully make more sense after watching
this video especially for those who have
been doubting the science and feeling
like this is an extreme reaction
I might take here is I'm a practical
optimist website is while this virus is
bad it could be way worse and this gives
us a chance as a global community to get
some systems and methods in place to
handle something potentially even more
drastic in the future also maybe it will
lead to changing some social norms like
replacing handshakes with fist bumps or
when people are really sick thinking
it's okay to mingle about and go to work
globally the normal flu kills anywhere
from a quarter to a half a million
people a year due in large part to
people not practicing good germ hygiene
so if this experience makes people more
socially aware of the right precautions
to take when they get sick that will
save countless lives for years to come
long after this coronaviruses old news
I make no mistake this is gonna be rough
for some more than others but history
has shown that us humans are pretty
resilient these types of things can
bring out the worst in us but they can
also bring out the best most wholesome
parts of us like these Italians
practicing their social distancing with
an impromptu balcony concert
how we feel about the situation is
largely dependent on just which part we
choose to focus on for me that means
being grateful to the heroes in our
healthcare system or the school lunch
ladies still providing free lunch for
kids who depend on them or the
scientists all over the world who are
working tirelessly seven days a week to
create better testing methods in a
vaccine there's gonna be a bumpy ride
for us but the economy will eventually
bounce back as it always does and we'll
be better off as a global community for
having gone through this again take this
seriously but there's absolutely no need
to panic we totally got this
well I just so happen to be filming at
their school the principal came over the
PA to make an announcement that kid at
the end is just an opportunist in fact a
common thread you'll see with successful
people is they treat their trials and
challenges as opportunities for growth
and while these are difficult times now
that our schedules have been totally

So I'm here today in Florida filming with Kevin more commonly known as TheBackyardScientist.
That's right!
And today we're going to take these two live grenades, and we're going to be dipping them in this tub of liquid nitrogen.
So go ahead and hand them to me.
And then-
DUDE! BABY ALLIGATOR! :D
oh no.
So now we're both about 15 feet away (4.5m) except I'm on land with a grenade on land,
and Kevin is in the water, with a grenade in the water.
So the question is, which one of us has a better chance of survival?
Take a moment to decide, do you dive on the pool deck, or jump in the pool?
We both had very different theories for survival. So as firm believers in the scientific method.
We decided to test out our hypotheses.
So we devised some experiments but before I get to those, I think it's important to understand
how a grenade actually works.
So once you pull the pin, as long as you keep this handle pushed down
You're perfectly safe, but as soon as you let go of the grenade. This handle springs off.
Which releases a spring loaded striker that hits a percussion cap
that starts a 5 second fuse, that you can't do anything to stop. (Oh great.)
but I never really thought about it until I made this video
but the reason you see a "waffle" pattern in grenades,
is to create weak points in the shell.
So that's where it's going to break first.
And since there are 40 bumps,
this grenade is basically an explosion
that shoots 40 bullets in all directions.
In warfare, that's what makes them lethal.
So the best strategy is to get as far as possible in a few seconds,
and then hit the deck with your feet facing towards the grenade.
This present the smallest possible target
for a flying grenade chunk to hit.
So 15 feet away (4.5m) mathematically that puts my chances of getting hit,
at less than 1%. (YAY!)
But things are even better for Kevin in the pool!
It's been documented that bullets do not travel far in water. At all.
The drag force is so high, they just disintegrate after a few feet.
So he has a 0% chance of getting injured by a grenade fragment, in the water.
But we are thorougher men of science, and we wanted more information.
So we designed an experiment, where we filled 3 balloons,
half with water, and half with air,
to roughly mimic the human body, which is mostly water.
But we have pockets of air in our lungs, intestines, in our sinuses, in our ears.
And then we subject them to identical explosions, identical distances apart
in both air
*BOOM!*
and water.
*Even more BOOM!*
As you can see, there isn't much effect on land because air is compressible.
which helps dissipate energy, plus the blast wave reflects around objects.
But in water, the story is different.
(Woah.)
Water is in-compressible. Which means not only is the blast wave not dissipated, but is passes right through your mostly water body.
So the air in the balloons, represents the air in your body.
Like your lungs, and your sinuses.
So basically, what's happening is
the blast wave is pushing in on you, but the air cavities can't push back with the same force, since they're filled with compressible air.
That means they move a lot, really quickly, which causes permanent damage.
As a control, you can see this balloon that is filled with just water.
It is perfectly fine.
That would be like your arms and legs, which have no air in them, and they are basically in-compressible like water and would be fine.
An explosion under water, is sort of like these silver ball things (Newton's cradle...)
So this represents the initial energy of the blast, which then comes down, and passes through
the in-compressible water, and then comes out without loosing any energy at the water surface.
but now you squish-able lungs are surrounded by in-compressible water, in the path of the blast wave.
And so, when the blast happens, there's a lot of relative motion.
Which is bad, if you like your lungs, the way the are right now. (I don't.)
And sadly, our experiment is verified in real life.
So the jerks, throw an M80 into the water, and you can see the devastating effect it has
on land, if a bird were that close to an M80, it would be startled, but it would be perfectly fine.
So now that you know, think back which did you choose?
While it's true, there is a small chance you would get unlucky with the grenade chunk,
if you choose to dive next to me.
If you choose to join Kevin, you will be in the pool, for the rest of your life.
(Rekt.)
So huge thanks, to the TheBackyardScientist for dying, in the name of science!
If you've never seen his stuff, you just have to check it out. Here's a video, we just finished filming.
It's a bunch of Oobleck, which is a non-Newtonian fluid, and we destroyed it in every way imaginable.
It's incredible footage, his channel is full of this type of junk, so check it out. Subscribe.
And as always...
Thanks for watching.
So I live, here, and I took a plane to Kevin's pool, way over here.
And on the plane ride, I was listening to the Harry Potter book series.
And I know this is quite possibly the least cool and sophisticated audio book recommendation that I've ever given on my channel.
But I read the books, 15 years ago, and it was really fun to rediscover like a bunch of the little details, that I'd forgotten
Plus the dude who reads them, does all of the voices.
And he does a really good job.
So if you want something fun to do, while commuting, or work around the house.
You can rediscover the Harry Potter book series, like me, or you can get any other book for free.
All you do is use the link in the description, or go to audible.com/MarkRober
By supporting Audible you support me, and future plane rides to places like Kevin's pool.
English subtitles by Iowyyn and corrected and made a little more funny by Icy Cubey. Now, go subscribe to Mark Rober.
I'm gonna give you guys more details on
I make a really cool glowing night kite
so if you didn't see my 250 square foot
super mario night kites start there
first and then come back here the
purpose is actually pretty simple you
start with the three volt coin battery
and an LED and then you duct tape the
leaves of the LED to the battery do this
with a few different colors of LEDs and
then stuff the LED no matter what color
into a 12 inch white opaque balloon like
this one then you fill them up with
helium then you create some sort of
lightweight frame then you take your
glowing balloons you attach it to your
frame with little strips of duct tape
and some sort of pattern and then you
float it in the sky but keep it tethered
to like with the string sort of like a
kite
here's a simple happy face right so a
base is cool but we wanted something
bigger so the obvious choice was a 250
square foot glowing Super Mario brother
and this is actually the image we used
right here when we were out there so
these thicker yellow lines are the cross
struts and then these thin lines right
here represents the pieces of string
that are in tension so once you have a
grid work like this it's kind of
straightforward you just give a red
white or blue wing you just match it up
and put it in the right spot let's talk
about the frame a little bit more
because honestly I think that's really
the only kind of tricky part here so
fundamentally the goal is light and
stiff so this one weighs about 70 grams
and it's using the same principles as a
suspension bridge so the strings are in
tension the carbon fiber tubes are in
compression which turns out to be a
really massive ficient way to make
something strong and stiff so it turns
out bamboo is a much cheaper alternative
that has almost as good as stiffness to
weight ratio as carbon fiber but bamboo
carbon fiber bamboo is kind of boring
I work for NASA so you probably also use
that camping tent pole but the point is
to be light and stiff so it's a little
complex but I bet for some of these
shapes I'm showing here you sort of like
a soccer style net and then sewed it in
the shapes of the letters kind of in a
tube and then stuff that full of the
glowing balloons that it would hold its
shape pretty well and also be pretty
lightweight so did a fair amount of
research of testing I even wrote a final
paper for a spacecraft material
selection course in grad school all the
materials used for this so check out all
the links in the video description and
leverage off what I learned to create
something way more awesome if you want
to see more creative junk like how to
lure gorilla with an iPhone or if you
want to see my 2012 Halloween costume
which is honestly better than the one
from last year then you best be
subscribing
[Music]
all right here's an idea for a
relatively simple Halloween costume
so basically white shirt cut a hole in
the front cut a hole in the back and
then you use some fake blood red paint
will work and then basically put a duct
tape and iPod to the front
after the iPad 2 and iPad to the back
and then start a FaceTime video chat and
kind of looks like you got a hole in
your body and if you're at a place that
has sucky y5 and you could use one of
these just a mobile Wi-Fi and then put
that in your pocket so you basically
have two iPads in this in your pocket
and it should look pretty cool and if
the party rats kind of lame then you can
always reverse
so I'm making this video to show you how
to protect yourself from a brand new and
really easy way for a bad guy to steal
your ATM PIN code with an iPhone even if
you're shielding the keypad so you can't
see you put it in and to show how hard
is even to detect that it happened I'm
gonna go into this store and steal
somebody else's code so watch closely to
see if you can tell the moment that I
actually do it so she just swiped her
ATM card and she's inputting the pin
here which is the last thing you do
before you finish your transaction and
then I step up to make my purchase so
that was it if you missed it let me play
that last part over again you see as I
walk up my phone does briefly hovers up
with the keypad so let me explain what
just happened so what I've got here is a
device from a company called FLIR that
just came out onto the market and it
clips onto the back of an iPhone and it
displays infrared which basically allows
you to see the temperature of things
here's where it gets interesting 30
seconds ago I was sitting on this couch
you probably can't tell where but how
about now but anytime two objects
interact they will tend toward thermal
equilibrium so they basically try and
meet in the middle temperature-wise and
since I'm warmer than the couch heat
flows from my body to the spot on the
couch where I'm sitting so this leaves
behind a thermal signature because it'll
take a little time for that spot on the
couch to cool back down and reach
thermal equilibrium once again with the
air likewise if I set my warm hand on
the cold wall afterwards my hand is
slightly colder but the wall is slightly
warmer where I touched it and as you
probably guessed by now your fingers
leave a thermal signature when you type
your PIN code into a debit card machine
like this and as you can see in this
case the PIN code was one two three four
five two three four yes that's amazing
I've got the same combination on my luck
and it gets worse because since the heat
signature fades with time the bad guy
could figure out the order in which the
keys were pressed because the hottest
button is likely the one that was
pressed last and the dimmest button is
likely the one that was pressed first so
after doing some digging around on this
I was able to find a paper that was
published about this method by some
researchers at UCSD several
years ago according to their data they
could guess the right pincode numbers
80% of the time if the image was taken
right after and if the image was taken a
full 1 minute later they still had a
50/50 chance of getting the numbers
right scary thing is back then infrared
cameras cost $10,000 and it would be
really hard to discreetly sneak
something of this size into the store
now an infrared camera looks like an
iPhone case there are a couple hundred
bucks and you can get them at any Apple
store however there are two pieces of
good news here the first is that this
won't work on all keypads for example
metal keypads reflect IR like a mirror
plus they're highly thermally conductive
which dissipates the heat quickly which
doesn't allow for a thermal signature to
even be left behind however I still
found plenty examples of rubber and
plastic buttons in my area that
definitely left behind a thermal
signature not to mention the other
applications beyond pin codes such as
door entry systems the second and this
is the real point of this video is that
it is really easy to defend against this
by simply resting your fingers on other
buttons as you type in your code as you
can see here this simple precaution
makes a meaningless thermal signature so
spread the word because it doesn't take
any extra effort or time and it makes
this potential threat a complete
non-issue oh and finally if you are part
of the 11% of the population whose pin
code actually is 1 2 3 4 5 consider this
sage advice change the combination on my
luck yes
Why should we spend money on NASA when we already have so many problems here on Earth?
If somebody asked you this question,
how would you answer?
It's been nearly five years since I left
But I came back to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory today to help answer this tough question
But before I even get to the five reasons I think we should spend money on NASA
I need to clear one thing up. What percentage of the US budget
Do you think goes to NASA? According to polls most Americans think it's 20 percent so it should come as no surprise
That one in four Americans think that NASA's budget should be reduced.
If you say the total budget represents a dollar or 100 pennies
The truth is NASA gets less than one-half of one penny.
For comparison, 16% goes to the military and 60% goes to social programs like Social Security, unemployment, Medicare and health care.
Okay, so if that is our foundation
Let me give you five incredible things that we get in return for that half a percent or less than nine dollars a year for most Americans
Just like some might ask
Why should we spend time exploring space when we have so many problems here on Earth? Some of our ancestors probably asked
"Why should we waste time trying to figure out agriculture when we have so much work to do hunting and gathering?" or
"Why should we spend so much time messing around in boats when we have so many issues here on the land?"
And the answer to all three of these questions is the same:
Reaching for new heights often creates new solutions and opportunities for people back on the ground, and I have some personal experience with this concept
As most of you guys know by now,
I spent seven of my nine years here at NASA working on the
Curiosity rover in fact some of my hardware is still working like a champ on the top deck of the rover
I'll be it a little dirtier since I touched it last but for my last two years here
I worked on a much lesser known project called SMAP and in some ways
I'm more proud of what it represents because SMAP is a super complex Earth orbiting satellite. Here's how it works.
Once it's in orbit the antenna boom is deployed and in this 20 foot gold mesh reflector
Origamis out like one of those Hoberman's sphere toys, and then the whole thing starts freaking spinning at 15 rpm
And it's using a Radiometer that can see through the clouds to measure the soil moisture levels on earth
This is important because soil moisture is one of the key vital signs of the planet.
By measuring the moisture levels in the soil, it allows you to predict droughts,
monitor floods and even predict crop yields for a given year and because the antenna spins around like that,
you're able to measure all the soil on Earth every two to three days.
So I left before it actually launched in 2015,
so the reason I am here today is to follow up with some SMAP research scientists to see how things turned out
I've been to many countries in Africa. People know about SMAP and the national government of those countries are trying to use it especially
for drought especially for crop monitoring. So NASA has a data access policy of you know making it free for everybody
There are three major cereal crop on the earth
wheat, rice and corn. If you can forecast these three major crops
So you know 70-80 percent of you know forecast you can do the crop field of the whole world. What Narenda is saying here is
Remarkable to me, and it sums up my first point perfectly SMAP costs to 900 million dollars
Africa is the continent with the most extreme poverty today. I did the math and for 900 million dollars
You could feed all of Africa for less than a day
But instead we invested in research and technology which empowers them to better help themselves
Increasing the amount of food they can make on their own
For decades as opposed to a one-time fleeting handout. Of the 37 missions currently running at JPL
I think it's so cool that about half are studying and helping earth, just like SMAP
This is a fancy way of saying
We should be doing everything within our power to make sure that nothing catastrophically bad happens to us
Hollywood got this right when they said that a large asteroid impact would be really bad news. Now the chances of this happening are small
But the potential consequences are so large just ask these guys
It makes sense to take it seriously. NASA has already put an asteroid early warning detection system in place and in October
2022 for the first time ever they will test ramming a
Spacecraft into an asteroid to see if you can deflect it off course with a mission called DART
But perhaps an even bigger threat to humans are humans
one of the goals of all of the Rovers that we sent to Mars is to gather data on what
It would take for humans to live there
Establishing a permanent human outpost on Mars would serve sort of like a backup hard drive for your computer in case something catastrophically bad
happened here on earth
America's first satellite was built here at JPL and now satellites make it so we can get GPS
driving directions on our phone or get TV beamed down to us from space or predict the path of hurricanes with much greater accuracy
Theword pixel in the concept of the first digital camera was also invented at JPL in the
1960s when an engineer was trying to solve how to get pictures of the planets and send them back to earth
In fact there are nearly
2,000 NASA technology spin-offs
We don't know what we don't know and so expecting NASA to justify its funding
But predicting all the amazing things it will discover would be like
Expecting Christopher Columbus when he was lobbying Queen Isabella for ships to predict the polio vaccine or Netflix
Of the 18 billion that NASA gets it's not like they're just putting that money on a rocket and launching it into space
The Majority of that money goes towards the salaries of
Tens of thousands of some of America's most skilled workers and one of the counter arguments here is yeah
But why do we need the government to fund these programs?
Why not let private companies do the innovating? Private space companies like SpaceX or Blue Origin are awesome
And they play an important role
But they're incentivized to pursue technologies that will give them a return on investment like space tourism or asteroid mining or launching satellites for other
organizations
there's just no incentive for a private company to invest in tracking and
Deflecting asteroids or investing in earth science missions like SMAP and then making the data
Available for free to anyone who needs it. So to recap for that less than half a penny from a dollar
Investment in NASA, not only do we improve life on Earth through projects like SMAP and protect ourselves against really catastrophic
Events and discover other incredible technologies to improve our lives along the way
But the money to make all that happen
goes back into growing the economy through the salaries of all the smart people doing their work. And my fifth and final reason why we
Should spend money on NASA even when we still have unsolved problems here on earth is perhaps the most important even if less concrete
Think it's captured best by what some call the most important picture ever taken
What you see here is the result of a 10-day exposure image from the Hubble Deep Space
Telescope with the exception of these three dots which are single stars
Every speck, smudge, and spiral you see in this image is a galaxy with hundreds of billions of stars
Just like our own Milky Way galaxy
Most remarkably the field of view captured here is the darkest part of the night sky the size of Roosevelt's eye on a dime
Held at arm's length we send men to the moon and orbiters to Saturn and Rovers to Mars
Not necessarily because there's some financial incentive or some quick payoff
We're looking to exploit, but because as humans there are fundamental burning questions we're eager to answer
The first person to set foot on Mars is alive right now. They could be in junior high or high school
He or she could be watching this video right now
It could be you I feel that our continued exploration of space in all its forms
fills me with hope and inspires me to reach higher and makes me a better person
I want to thank Bill and Melinda Gates for teaming up with me on this video if you want to know why they think there's still a
Case for being an optimist in today's world even with all the negative headlines you should check out the Bill and Melinda Gates
Annual letter at gatesletter.com this optimism stems from facts like the number of children who die every year has been cut in half
so has extreme poverty declining by half in less than twenty years and more children are attending school now than ever before but we're
Optimistic not just because we know life used to be worse
It's seeing the positive trend line of all the ongoing work by brilliant folks like at NASA and elsewhere
Who are working to improve life on Earth by solving some of the world's toughest challenges
I will leave a link to the letter in the video description
you just play an animation and then slip
it into the pocket on the back which is
designed to snugly fit pretty much any
sized mobile device and there you go
here's an example of a costume I put
together 10 minutes with an old shirt
old tie a little bit of red paint now I
wouldn't actually comes with double
stick tape so you could stick it
directly to your body or you can just
stick it to the back of your shirt so my
buddy raha took the I wound out in
public to see what they thought and this
is basically what
[Music]
you
sup y'all it's me mark so I've promised
you guys a new video every month and for
those of you paying attention yes it is
the last day of the month but before you
start hating you should know I've been
in New York cross-training at night so
as you guys know the general goal of my
videos is to showcase some cool new idea
or concept that's totally original and
you won't find anywhere else on YouTube
so this month is a little different in
that I didn't come up with this idea but
I looked all over the web and I cannot
find any half-decent instructions on how
to pull this off so I'm gonna show you
what I learned and how I did it so last
week I went with my brother and my dad
to Houston for this Halloween trade show
to showcase digital duds to some buyers
and we didn't want people touching the
shirts or the ipod touches inside of
them so we made sort of these shadow
boxes sort of like a jewelry display
case but much cooler because the edge
lit it with some LEDs and it looked
really sharp you can make essentially
one of these for under a hundred bucks
so here are some of the details on how
to do it so step one you are going to
need a really cool older brother like
I've got his name is Brian and he can
pretty much build anything out of wood
in fact if you give him a sweet beard
some awesome hair he is pretty much
indistinguishable from Bob Vila although
when I made that graphic I realized if
you pretty much give anyone a sweet
beard and some awesome hair they are
indistinguishable from Bob Vila but I
digress point is do can freakin build
anything so I gave him a call and kind
of explaining the concept we brainstorm
for a little bit and then he went to
town so here are the four tables kind of
built up the next step was he painted
them and then here's the real key down
on Amazon these LED strips they're like
17 feet long and they come with a remote
controller you can change the color see
you double stick tape put them on one
side of the box and you get these for
like 30 bucks the link that where to get
them is in the description
so right here we are cycling through the
different colors with the remote control
the next step is you need to edge
something onto the acrylic top or you
could use glass so it'll come with a
protective covering and we stenciled out
and cut out other protective covering
the logo in Reverse because it's on the
underside and then you can use light
sandpaper or really it works best if you
have a little mini sand blaster like
this
links in the description you get them
for 40 bucks so this is using a glass
too but the concepts the same so now the
logo when you peel off the protective
covering is etched in the underside of
the table and the other thing you want
to do is use some sandpaper to rough up
the edges of the acrylic because it's
those rough edges that the light catches
and then it makes it shine and that's
basically what I'm showing here it's a
cross-section so that's the LED on the
table the acrylic top comes down and
again now the light hits it and any
surface that's sort of rough the light
refracts off it and then it lights up
and here's in real life how it actually
looks oh it's really cool it's just a
dumb glass top well that light comes
right on the edge and then it really
makes it pop
[Music]
so if you want some extra credit you can
actually take the extra length of the
LED cuz it's 17 feet long and put it on
the underside of the table all around
and then this is about what it'll look
like and then you're just an absolute
champion so there you have it thank you
for subscribing and for watching every
month
and if you'd like most of the videos
I've done so far the next four or five
videos are gonna be pretty awesome just
sayin
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
I sit in a jacuzzi brimmed with sand.
(Laughter)
This is one of the best things ever!
If you take sand like this and add air to it the correct way, it will turn into a liquid soup.
(Music)
In science, this phenomenon is called the fluid bed.
It is used in industry for powder coating and silos (grain), to ensure that the grains flow smoothly from the outlet.
(Music)
With air, the surface has almost no friction. As a table air hockey.
(Music continues)
And when the air stops, everything freezes into place.
(Music continues)
So today I will show you how to build a similar simplified version on your own.
And then because it piqued my curiosity, what if I completely immerse myself in something like this ...
We have built a jacuzzi sized version. As you can see, there is a 60-year-old video showing this experiment by the British Royal Institute, meaning that this experiment is not new
I've wanted to build one for a long time,
But you can hardly get information on the Internet to build one. So, I collected some drawings in the patent for some large factories
And I noticed that instead of having one big air outlet, they all have small air outlets.
Although I knew this, it took 25 unsuccessful attempts to outline this design.
As you can see, it's just a bunch of half-inch plastic tubes arranged in the form of a ladder.
But the secret is to open two holes of a diameter of 1 mm at a distance of 90 degrees from each other, and make a quantity of them with a spacing of 25 mm.
Then, tape all the tubes together, and make the direction of the holes down so that the sand does not enter inside
Then just seal the container with some hot glue. Then fill the container with sand or glass beads.
You can run it with a small air pump like this, or you can rent a nitrogen cylinder for $ 30 and run it for 10 minutes per cylinder.
As usual, I will include links to all the pieces I used in the explanation of the video.
So my friend Ken has a broken jacuzzi in his backyard, which we decided to use
(Music)
(Laughter)
When it stops, you feel as if you are being held in place and have a heavy blanket on every part of your body.
(Laughter) Ah!
(Music)
And now that I have tested it and made sure of its readiness, I will proceed with my mission to become the favorite Uncle (Awa, Uncle English does not distinguish) ...
Bio bio bio bio, uh! (screaming)
I decided to surprise my nephews (or my English sister, she does not discriminate)
(Creaking sound)
Lo and behold!
Ahhh!
(Laughter)
(Music) (Laughter and screams)
But before we swim in the sand, let's talk about the science behind this fluid bed
Wait wait, don't go if you think science is boring and you're new to this channel
You should know that my method is similar to the way of hunting folklopers (a type of dinosaur).
I try to get people to be attractive or cool to look at and then when they least expect it
Roar ... a clever girl, the folklore makes a sound
I admit that a summary will appear at the end, but be executed if you stay with me for two minutes
I promise to make it easier to understand and to take into account not to make it seem trivial
Fluidization is only if there is sufficient force of air pressing up equal to the force of gravity or weight down.
And then what happens is that every grain of sand floats in the air in equilibrium like this
You can imagine it as something in the middle tug of war. If something is in equilibrium.
Which means that there is an equilibrium and no one can pull in its direction (air - gravity)
Nevertheless, if we add Steve Austin (a famous wrestler) to one direction, we will lose the balance on either side.
And it is exactly what happens if we pump more air
That is, when liquefaction occurs the sensitive point is when sand floats evenly
This makes it free to move and you can also notice that some swimming pools are pumped with air to reduce the impact of the diver.
Now you notice that there are things floating on the surface of the sand and things that are sinking
This has to do with buoyancy force and it follows this equation (buoyancy force = fluid density * body density * gravity)
When there is an object under a pressure gradient, and there are forces pressing on it from all sides, they compress more as they go down.
This is why you ache more when you are the person at the bottom in the dogpile game (a game involving several people jumping over one of them) or you feel pain in your ears whenever you dive deep into the pool.
This makes sense, the deeper you go, the more water it breaks, and in turn, it will push you down.
And if you add together the size and direction of these stocks, you will find that some of them cancel the other and you will have the resultant (combined) forces pushing you up.
These are buoyancy forces, and if your buoyancy forces are greater than gravity, they will float.
If the buoyancy forces are less than gravity, it will sink.
Now, we usually think of buoyancy forces in water, but you can imagine it with a Helum balloon with our atmosphere (air).
So here's the trick question: Which of these have higher buoyancy powers?
It's actually a ball? Buoyancy forces have nothing to do with the density of an object, but only with size.
So, since the ball takes more volume, it has more buoyancy forces.
But you can object that why does the ball sink and the balloon float?
Remember, it's like a tug of war, the ball sinks because the forces of gravity on the thick rubber and the compressed air inside it have greater buoyancy forces.
But with regard to the balloon, although it does not have the forces of buoyancy of the ball,
It keeps floating, because the forces of buoyancy are greater than the force of weight (gravity) by helium and thin rubber.
And helium will rise as a ball rising from the bottom of a pool.
Then it will stop at the place where the density of air is equal to that of helium inside the balloon,
Because there the tug-of-war players will tie.
View! we're done! Now let's go back to my brother's children (or my sister's English does not differentiate).
(guffaw)
(Squawk)

(Squawk with laughter)
Oh no! I can't get it out!
Take it! (Nephew) I can't! (His other nephew) Take it! Stop it!
Well, stop it! (Laughter)
Birthdays are approaching, and with the help of Casper who are in turn supporting this video, I protect your back (an expression that he brought a benefit)

so in this short tutorial video I show
you how to make a guerrilla cam which is
basically just an air with a hole in it
so you start with the mirror it's a
couple bucks from Home Depot
put it in the bathtub so you get some
water so there's some lubrication I
start with a 1/8 inch drill bit
it's got to be carbide tips we can go
through the glass I'll take about four
minutes to get that first kind of pilot
hole in there and then once it's in
there then you switch to a 3/16 which is
the perfect size for an iPhone camera
and then doubt the holes there already
it only takes about 10 seconds you can
punch it through and then to make it
easier to handle I put some weather
stripping just all along the edges and
then to hold the weather stripping there
I use some masking tape and that looked
really well and you could drop it and it
was kind of cushy so now you kind of
line up the phone so you can it lines up
the camera goes right through the hole
and then I marked it with some marker
and then I took some more weather
stripping just to kind of make a guide
so you can set it in there otherwise
it's really squirrely on the back and
it's hard to line it up this also turns
out to be a great way to visualize
infinity without your dumb head getting
in the way so that's basically how it
works
[Music]
so today we're at your cliff jumping to
show a simple trick that using little
high school physics and a stopwatch you
can judge the height of really tall
objects so this is my buddy David and
for the sake of Instagram bragging
rights he wants to know how high the
clip is he's about to throw his body off
of now thanks to science season luck
because if you simplify Newton's second
equation of motion you get this that
means if you want to know how high the
clip is in feet as long as you jump
straight out without an initial velocity
either up or down all you have to do is
count how many seconds it takes to hit
the water square it and then multiply it
by 16 so if it takes 1 second 1 times 1
is 1 times 16 the clip is 16 feet high
so if it takes 2 seconds into water 2
times 2 is 4 times 16 is 64 so the clip
is 64 feet tall it's that simple
so in David's case we tighten him at one
point seven two seconds in the air which
means the clip was 48 feet tall and like
any self-respecting man of science we
verified our calculations by taking a
string that we had marked out with
measurements and it turns out we were
within 2 feet now for those of you think
this is cool but you just don't like
math I actually made a really simple
free app and I put it in the app store
it's called cliff height timer so all
you have to do is you said start at the
start of the jump and then stop at the
end and then it'll tell you the actual
height of the cliff now a lot of people
think that the heavier an object is the
faster it will fall so we tested that
fun fact 10 pound bowling balls actually
float now I weigh actually 17 times more
than this bowling ball but as you can
see here we actually fall at the same
rate now that's actually great news
because it means you can figure out the
height of the cliff before you jump just
by throwing a rock off of it that's
something you're probably thinking wait
so you're telling me a bowling ball
falls just as fast as a beach ball and
the answer that they do if there is no
air now this was most famously
demonstrated by commander David Scott on
the moon for Apollo mission 15 well in
my left hand I have a feather my right
hand a hammer and I'll drop the two up
here and hopefully go hit the ground at
the same time
how about that so it's true on earth air
resistance can play significant role
especially on lighter objects with
shapes that tend to catch air but for
most solid compact objects like a rock
or a heavy stick it's going to be a
really great approximation for how long
it would take a human body to fall at
least rights under 200 feet or so
because then air resistance starts
playing a greater role for all objects
as they sort of start approaching their
terminal velocity but what I really love
about the simple equation is that it's
incredibly versatile for example you can
get a pretty good estimation on the
height of a tree by throwing a rock up
to the same height as the tree and then
start tightening writing the rock stops
going up and begins to come down with
this equation you can measure the depth
of something you can't even see by just
timing until you hear the rock hits
something on the bottom or let's say a
mysterious gaping hole suddenly appears
in a remote section of Siberia you want
to know the depth but you don't want to
get close to the edge you just throw a
rock straight out and time till you're
splash but what I love most about the
simple equation is that even if you
weren't there and the footage is grainy
it's from a bad angle you can verify the
height of your buddy's hundred foot
cliff jump and not surprisingly
according some data I collected 80% of
all hundred foot cliff jumps on YouTube
aren't
Oh
it's that simple
I'm Mark.
Hey Vsauce, I'm Jake!
And today we are in a replica of the Home Alone house
that Jake built with his very own hands.
So, as thorough men of science, we have set up a
few experiments to test some questionable scenes
from a few Christmas classics. First, from A Christmas
Story, if you can really shoot your eye out with the
Red Rider BB gun? And then from Elf, what happens when
you actually get hit with a snowball at 95 miles an hour?
And finally from Home Alone, what happens if you get
a blow torch on your head for 7 seconds?
Not yet, Jake!
And these will be the first time we're running these tests,
so we truly don't know what's going to happen,
but as firm believers in the scientific method, we're going
to test our hypotheses and then see who is closer to
the final result. And the winner gets to keep the leg
lamp behind us.
What happens to the loser?
The loser has to wear Ralphie's pink bunny suit.
Are you ready to do this?
Yes!
Let's do it. Let's go.
So in the movie A Christmas Story, all Ralphie wants for
Christmas is a Red Rider BB gun, but all the
adults in his life keep saying "No" because they say
"You'll shoot your eye out, kid." What do you
think Jake? I do think that they're not talking about his eye
actually coming out, because you have the optic nerve in there which is
about as thick as your pinky. I think they really mean that
the BB is going to penetrate the eye and then it'll go blind
which, nobody wants.
Nobody wants that!
And that seems quite a legitimate concern, right?
And because they say that he'll shoot his own
eye out, essentially that means that he shoots, the BB
goes out, bounces off something, and hits his own eye.
So to test this out, we have an authentic Red Rider
BB gun, and since Jake wouldn't volunteer,
Sorry about that.
I had to find some cow eyes that they use for like
biology classes and dissections. And so, as a control,
we're going to make sure the BB will penetrate the
eye first without even bouncing off anything.
Alright, so that went straight through. There was like no
issues.
The real question though is the ricochet, right? That
is true to the movie. So ,on this next one, we're going to have the BB
come straight, it'll hit this steel plate, and then bounce into the eye.
So, will it make it through the eye?
I think, yes. I mean, as you said, it had so much energy, it went
all the way into the eye. I think it will hit the plate,
ricochet off, and go right into the eye. No problem.
I think it's going to hit the plate, it's going to like put a
dent in it, it will lose a bunch of energy and it will hit
the eye but it won't penetrate it. So, take a moment to
guess in the comments below. Who's right?
Me or Jay. Probably me. And, uhh, let's check it out.
Yeah, let's do it.
Totally didn't go through. It is interesting though, you
can see the dent in the plate. And I think that was the
culprit. Oh totally, and what's also interesting is how much
energy the eye absorbed. It was, yeah, I don't know
, I think it was really great.
It's a fair point though, a cow's eye is definitely thicker
than a human's eye. So, if that were Ralphie, that's bad
news. Like a half of a million people a year lose their
eyesight due to like eye injuries. So, eye protection is
definitely important. But, most importantly, I won
this challenge.
Ok, so I'm up 1-0, heading into round
2. The movie Elf, Buddy is sort of screwing up a bunch
of things in the big city, and nobody likes him.
But then, his brother gets attacked by a bunch of thugs
in Central Park, and he shows off his mad Elf skills.
So, I did some investigating, and I found the spot in
Central Park where this actually occurred. Then I
measured the distance, and then I also watched the video
back and with how many frames it took and then calculated
the velocity of the snowball. Turns out, they're going to
throw it at 95 miles per hour.
Oh my gosh.
And yeah, the punks don't even move at all. So the
question for round 2, is would you fall backwards if you
got hit by a snowball at 95 miles an hour?
I would say...no. I think you might stumble backwards
a little bit, but it's not going to knock you flat on
the ground. And I disagree, 95 miles an hour is very
fast. And that something hit your chest, you're
going to move, and stumble back, unlike your
hypothesis. Umm. but how are we going to get a
a snowball going 95 miles per hour?
That's a great question, and I don't know the answer
to it. I originally wanted to use my snowball machine gun.
But, that tops out at like 40 miles an hour.
Yeah that's not good enough.
Luckily, as it turns out that if you do the math,
that a softball travelling at 65 miles an hour
will push you back, just as much as a snowball travelling
at 95 miles an hour. And that's because they have the
same momentum, which is defined as the weight of
something multiplied by how fast it's going. So, since
the softball weights a bit more, it needs to be travelling a
little bit slower to have the same like push back, or
momentum transferred to you. And thankfully, I have
a way to make a softball go 65 miles an hour.
Awesome.
Ready to suit it up.
Wh..why?
Oh...so you lost the first round...so losers always
No, no. We don't have to this.That's fine.
You lost.
[Fanfare]

Oh.
It looks like the softball pushed Jay back slightly, but
not as much as I hypothesized. So that means that
we're all tied up, heading into the final round.
In the movie Home Alone, Kevin is defending his house
from the Wet Bandits with all these amazing homemade
booby traps, which we actually made a video of that
on Jake's channel Vsauce3, so you should go check that
out. One of these booby traps is in the kitchen, so
when Joe Pesc walked in, the blowtorch goes off
with like 4000 degrees of heat and he just sits there
and takes it for 7 seconds. After which, he runs with  his
head on fire for an additional 4 seconds and plunges
his head in the snow. And in the end, this is what the
damage looks like. I, you know,  don't think that it is, uhh,
realistic at all. I, uhh, agree that it seems like an
underrepresentation of the damage that would have
been done. So to test this out, the good news is, we
actually have a volunteer. Oh, that's lovely.
So, underneath this beanie is a layer of chicken skin
and then I drilled into the foam head
about 2 inches down and put a bead. And so, the
question is, do you think it will be hot enough to burn
through the beanie, through the skin, and then two
inches down into the head. I think yes, given the
duration of time and the amount of heat. It's gonna be
pretty severe. It's a bold.. it's a bold claim. I don't think
it will actually get all the way down. Alright, well, let's
uhh, check it out.
Now, it's time.
After filming this video, I was curious, so I talked
with a couple of expert surgeons from the Arizona Burn Center.
And they told me that if this actually happened to you,
in less than a second, you would have a 3rd degree
burn. They said that the chicken was a
good under-representation of the skin covering your skull, and
it would take between 10 milliseconds to burn through
the hat down to the bone. At that point, you still got 8
seconds left and your skull would protect your brain
so it wouldn't be fatal, but it would be so damaged that
you probably would need skull reconstruction to replace
the charred portion and that carries with the
complications that can be fatal. Our moment of truth...
let's see, it doesn't look like it's gonna...
Ohhh, yes it is. Oh man, ok, so the beanie exposed.
very exposed. Curse you.....
So, a disappointing hearty congratulations to Jake for
winning. You can keep the amazing light lamp.
We actually made a video in this exact spot on his channel.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Like I said, on Jake's channel, we went beyond
just blowtorches in Home Alone to to see if some of the other booby traps would actually kill you.
So go check that out, make sure you comment below.
Let us know if you did better than Jake or I in your guesses.
I want to give a shout-out to...I can't do it.
Better shout out to Audible for their support on this video.
So, I showcased my amazing BB gun shooting skiils today, but
I'm afraid I am no match for Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, who
is actually the deadliest sniper in U.S History.
And he wrote a book called American Sniper, which I
recently just listened to on Audible. He was nicknamed The
Devil and actually had a bounty on his head. That's why
the guy is on the other side. But his fellow Navy Seals
called him the Legend. The book is a pretty broad view of what
war was like, and how it pretty much sucks for everyone.
It tells a lot of stories of what he went through and he
doesn't share his coat much, which I found refreshing.
And, as usual,the book is way better than the movie,
so if you want to listen to American Sniper or any other
book for free, all you have to do is use the link in the
description or go to audible.com/MarkRober.
If you neveer tried an audio book, the holidays are a
great time to check it out while you are traveling.
Plus, they also make a really great gift.
Thank you for watching.
I'm here today at NASA's Jet Propulsion
laboratories as you guys know doing
space stuff is really difficult so the
recent incident by a private space
company trying to get supplies to an
International Space Station serves as a
reminder that there is nothing routine
about pushing the limits of mankind will
help alleviate some of that stress here
in NASA they will pay pumpkin-carving
contest every Halloween and let me just
preamp the super witty comments about
your tax dollars at work by saying they
only have one hour to do everything
you're about to see and all the pumpkins
and supplies are always purchased with
their own money these guys are some of
the most brilliant and hard-working
people I've ever met
so enjoy their awesomeness team Boddie
have some fun carve
[Music]
let's pry this one here

Nasa JPL's rover named curiosity
Successfully landed on mars a few days ago
Appropriately, there's been a lot [of] focus on curiosity the rover but what I think makes jPL really great aren't it's robots
It's the people who build them
I can say this because I met a lot of them in the seven-year span I got to work on curiosity at JPL
That's nearly my entire professional career and a quarter of my life
I had a son and lost my mom to ALS while working on curiosity
I'm a different person now than when I started
as a result of this whole experience and all the people I've been able to associate with and while my
Contributions small relative to the overall picture. I tried to capture here exactly what it felt like to basically
have seven years of your life indicated with that beautiful phrase: " touchdown confirmed. we are safe on Mars"
So we're still two days from landing, but you see the news media has already started to
descend on JPL here
since we're all kind of nerds around here our office pools looks a little different than most
This is the landing ellipse for the Rover and we all kind of place guesses on where we think it's going to come down
So we're headed down to Nasa JPL to hang out with everyone and watch the landing
coming with my cute wife and my dad's gonna be there too
It's pretty exciting kind of sick to my stomach at the same time
Basically seven years of my life and career come down to about seven minutes
I'm kinda freaking out
I owe half my chomosomes to that guy right there is my dad
excellent chances.  I'm not nervous
when Mark gets nervous he starts shivering like he's freezing
and right now it's about 85 degrees out here so
Mark is really nervous
i used to watch the apprentice and right before they hit with the board room
i'd have like eight blankets on me shivering something about the donald scared me (If I only knew what was coming 5 years later :/
We are in powered flight
skycrane has started
Touchdown confirmed.  WE ARE SAFE ON MARS!!!
It was honestly a moving experience to see that picture come up that showed the shadow of the Rover
just dominating the Martian landscape
It's just a crazy thought
that something I've designed, I've touched, I've built, I've integrated
I've tested, is now
safely resting on another freaking planet
It's a crazy feeling
Oh, here we go... [courtesy horn]
Yes!
Thats what I call the courtesy honk
I just pushed this custom button
And it's two super quick chirps of the horn that are not only friendly sounding
but it's intentionally not as loud as a normal horn, so I'm gonna show you how and why I did this
and in the process I will explain what this red button does
But first I'm gonna pull over.
1.3 million people die in car crashes per year so you really wanna be able to communicate with other drivers if you wanna stay safe
but if you think about it, cars only have two built in ways to communicate with each other: you got your turn signal
and your horn...[normal horn]
and the turn signal is fine but the problem with the horn is that it is so one dimentional
is like, if your only tool is a hammer, it is really good at one thing, but it sucks at everything else
and I don't know about you, but now that pretty much everybody owns a smartphone, 99% of the time I use my horn
I'm not trying to avoid a crash, I'm trying to let the person in front of me know: It's time to stop reading that text they just received
And that's the issue. I'm not upset. I just wanna be like: Hey, dude, the light is green. No big deal
And that might come as a surprise, because I drive a Jetta
But i'm not some hardcore angry road rage tough guy but even this Jetta which has just about the
most emasculating horn possible sounds
angry when you honk it at a light
and if you try to do a nice quick honk it
doesn't usually register because it
bottoms out too quick so I just push my
custom-made courtesy honk button
and because it's so non confrontational this
will never happen to me
and this works for communicating in a lot of situations
not just at stoplights like if someone is
just sort of drifting in your lane
you're not sure if they see you or not
but you don't want to use your big horn
or if you just want to get someone's
attention
to tell them something if someone needs
to move forward in traffic or in a
drive-thru it's nice because you don't want to
seem like a jerk as they can look right
at you in their rear view mirror
You can even use it as a way to say thank you
and I kind of feel like there should be
a standard feature on all cars so you
still have your big horn that you can't
miss in the case of an emergency but
there should be a smaller button right
over here for the courtesy honk but the good
news is that as an engineer
if something isn't exactly how you want
it you just make it exactly how you want it
so I've been on Amazon and got one of
these Adafruit sound boards for 27 bucks
where you can upload sound effects via
USB with no programming required and
then I got three of these cool horn
buttons to trigger the sound effects for
seven bucks each so i started on this
side by wiring this to my cigarette
lighter for power and then I used a 12 to
5 volt power inverter to get me to the
right voltage for the sound board which
is connected to these buttons to trigger
the horn sound effects I dragged and dropped
onto there and then coming out of the
board we have a 3.5 millimeter audio
cable that plugs into a $13 amp to make
it loud enough which connects to a 13
dollar PA speaker now that we have all
the components my buddy Bob from the
YouTube channel I Like To Make Stuff
came over and we got to work soldering
actually I did all the work while Bob
just stroked that magnificent beard of
his he also made a video about making a
custom horn like this that goes into way
more detail so definitely check his out
if you're actually planning on doing
this. This is intentionally more of a
temporary setup but I wanted mine to be
a bit more permanent in the dash so with the
help of my talented buddy Howard we went
to town installing this thing
now the buttons were in place we
connected them through the dash to the
PA speaker rebounder to the frame under
the hood. We also installed this beast
which is the same type of horn system
used on trains and semi-trucks basically
there's a compressor that fills an air
tank to 120 psi which powers the horn
but more on this later
and the buttons
also light up which makes them look
really cool at night. I also added one more
sound effect that's powered by this button
This is designed to be even one knotch
nicer than the courtesy honk if you want
to be super chill and grab the attention
of a pedestrian who isn't even in a car
So that's my pitch to make our roads
more pleasant by increasing the
vocabulary of the standard car horn and
now you can do it yourself which leads
me to this final button which is only to be
use in extreme situations like when two
teenagers are taking their sweet time
to cross the street in front of you
while fidget spinning
I wanna thank audible for their support on this video
not only are they the best when it comes
to audio books but they've been working with me and
supporting my channel for a couple of
years now while making this video I
listen to the book "Surely You're Joking
Mr. Feynman and I loved it"
Richard Feynman was a genius Nobel Prize winning
physicist who chilled with Einstein and
helped discover atomic energy but that's
not what makes him so interesting this
collection of stories from his life made
me laugh out loud a bunch of time it
starts when he was a kid and used to take
apart radios to make homemade burglar
alarm and then in college at MIT he used his engineering skills to pull pranks and
then he eventually taught himself how to
break into safes and use science to pick
up on women he had this lifelong
fascination with learning but in a
practical sense not in a memorize facts
from the textbook sense he's just such an
intelligent colorful human being so if you
want to listen to "Surely You're Joking
Mr. Feynman" or any other audio book for
free all you have to do is use the link in
the description or go to audible.com/markrober
Thanks for watching
This guy took a package from my porch and now he's about to open it in his car
But what he doesn't know is this is a custom-built bait package that is recording him on four different cameras
And it's about to unleash a pound of the world's finest glitter along with some other surprises.
But to understand how he got to this point first. We need to rewind a bit.
About seven months ago, I noticed a package being reported as delivered but it never arrived.
So when I checked our security cameras, I noticed this lovely couple out for a stroll.
As you can see, they have backpacks on and they're just going around the neighborhood
making an afternoon out of this.
If you ever been in a situation like this,
you just sort of feel violated. And then I took this to the police and even with the video evidence,
they said it's just not worth their time to look into -  so then you also feel powerless and I just felt like
something needs to be done to take a stand against dishonest punks like this. And then I was like: hold up,
I built a dartboard that moves to get a bulls-eye every time. I spent nine years designing hardware that's currently roving around on another freaking
planet. if anyone was going to make a revenge bait package and over-engineer the crap out of it,
it was going to be me.
So I started with a sketch and some CAD and then I hit up my buddy Sean who is really good with this type of
small electronic stuff, and we got to work. Ultimately, when they open the package
I just wanted to celebrate their choice of profession with a cloud of glitter because, I mean, who doesn't love glitter?
That's easy. I could just do that passively with like a spring when it opens
But I also wanted to record their reaction and that's what makes the engineering here an order of magnitude more
difficult because if you think about it
This thing has to sit on a porch all day and it can't be plugged in and you have no idea when someone will come
And pick this up
so it's not like you could just hit record on the camera and then put it in the box because you're gonna run out of
battery and storage space on top of that
I need some way to recover this footage in case I never get the big package back so after six months and lots of design
Iterations and so much testing here's where we landed
This custom printed circuit board is the brains of the operation
It has a built-in accelerometer
And when it's jostle that will check the GPS signal to see if it's been moved from the porch
and if so
It sends a signal to all the phones to wake up and start recording and I'm using four phones that have a wide-angle
Filming mode and are angled back and this 3d printed portion is contoured this way because it represents the field of view of the phones
So as you can see
I'm guaranteed to capture their reaction no matter which way they open it from and nestled in here
We've got a can of fart spray. No joke, you can clear a room with one spray of this stuff
so we made a cam on a small motor that sprays it five times and not only is this just a nice touch but we
Keep repeating five sprays every 30 seconds until they throw the package out of their car or house
Before they realize there's four phones inside this
Increases our chances of finding it because we always know the package location at all times due to the GPS on the phones
But even if we don't recover it all four phones have LTE data plans
So they upload the footage to the cloud so I can still see what happened
And then for the pièce de résistance we have a cup here on top that spins from a motor underneath
So once you load in a but ton of the world's finest glitter the motor spins really fast and the centrifugal force
Fires it evenly in all directions. Let me cut holes on the side of the lid and cover them with one-way film
so two of the cameras can see them as they walked away and then finally to make it look like an actual delivered package we
Added some shrink wrap and a delivery label
Which is perhaps my favorite part of the whole thing because if the thief wasn't in such a hurry
They'd see that the package is actually coming from my childhood hero and inspiration for this project Kevin McCallister. I
Even looked up and amusing the address of the actual house
They filmed the movie in and of course it's being shipped to his boys
Harry and Marv and there's a charge port in the bottom because if it doesn't get stolen in a given day I can bring it
In and then recharge all the batteries in the system overnight
So the idea is the bad guy comes and takes it off your porch then lifts the lid and these two limit switches
Tell the circuit board brain inside that the lids been removed
and then that sets everything in motion and I may be biased but sometimes a well engineered design is
beautiful
And because the phones have GPS we created a virtual geo fence around my house
So I get a notification when the package has been moved off the property
So I put it out on the porch and now all that was left to do was wait
Okay, so I was at work and I got a notification that the Geo fence we set up had been tripped
So then I checked the cameras and sure enough. The package is gone
So I checked the GPS and sort of tracked it and it appears there in a car because they seem to leave my house
Pretty quickly, but it seems to have stopped in a parking garage
Which is where I'm headed to now and if you're new here, this isn't a prank channel
So I am completely out of my comfort zone
And there she is
This is like recovering the black box of a crashed airplane it would still work
even if I didn't get the box back that footage would upload to the cloud but it's just faster to plug the phones in so
I'm gonna go home and find out how this
Somehow ended up here. So it appears he was walking down the sidewalk and then suddenly makes a hard left
Then he takes the package and gets in his car and eventually makes it to this parking garage where this glorious sequence unfolds
My car dude everything oh my god
My friend Cece has also had some packages stolen so she has to leave it on her porch for a few days to
So the moral of the story is just don't take other people's stuff
Not only is it not cool, but on the plus side, you'll never find yourself in this situation or perhaps even worse this one

When the super soaker was first invented,
it was a game changer in my neighborhood.
So I wanted to make a version of my own,
only instead of shooting water it would shoot paint.
But my wife wont let me shoot it in the house,
so my awesome brother made me this.
But its not really fun to shoot a paint gun by yourself,
so in my ongoing quest to be the favorite uncle,
I decided to invite my nieces and nephews.
You guys ready to do this?
Wait, we're gonna ruin our clothes!
Ah, good point.
But before we drastically change the appearance of this room,
let's just take a moment to appreciate the build quality.
Shoutout to David and Ryan from the YouTube channel Eclectical Engineering for helping with the guns.
They're the same guys who help me build the world's largest nerf gun.
You guys ready to do this?
Okay.
Goooo!
Say hello to my little friend!
So, that could've gone better,
but I still have some science to discuss.
Each gun has a pump which gets power from a battery,
and a pump is just a propeller that spins really fast,
and pulls paint from this side and just shoots it out
Nobody cares!
And now it was personal,
which left me only one option.
YouTube superstar colinfurze.
You know, this guy.
Colin- Hello Mark, how's it going?
Not great!
Colin- The *bark* are you wearing?
Colin- Are you covered in paint?
Yeah, I challenged my nieces and nephews to a paint war and it didn't go very well,
so, I need your help Colin.
Colin- So basically, you need old Furze's help here,
Colin- so you can go there and totally destroy your nieces and nephews?
Pretty much.
You've come to the right place!
Right, let me think, let me think,
what do we got, what can we do?
Yup.
I've got it, this is what we need to do!
Its gonna get proper hot when you do this, alright?
So don't put this thing anywhere near this
*laughs* your face could be a mess.
You soak this in gasoline, alright?
When you throw this in the air, okay, make sure you catch
And that's it.
I think if you do everything I've told ya
those kids are not gonna stand a chance mate
you're gonna totally destroy them.
Now next thing, what are you wearing mate?
Come on! How many times have I told ya hey look
the part you've got to do the dress
Good luck!
(music)
you might have noticed I hung a bunch of
blank white canvases on the wall before
we started so if you need some new wall
decor I'm gonna tell you how you can get
one in just a second but first I want to
say thank you to a company that I
discovered recently called Kiwicrate.com for sponsoring this video
if you've never heard of them they ship these
crates to your house that have science
experiments or games or crafts for kids
and the contents of the box have a
different theme each month and they vary
in complexity for kids from age 3 all
the way through high school and the
coolest part is it's not just another
toy because they're creating the project
and learning the fundamental principles
and then they get a play with it I
tested this out with my nephew's by
shipping them all boxes and they totally
loved them so if you're looking for a
worthwhile and non lame Christmas
present for a young person in your life
this is it and you can do a one-time
shipment or you could subscribe so they
have something to look forward to in the
mail every month which is what I'm
getting my nephew's to make up for
drowning them in paint best of all if
you use the link of the description or
the promo code: kiwicrate.com/markrober
not only is your first month
free but as a thank you I will randomly
select from those who use the code and
personally ship you one of these
canvases until I run out
I wanna thank Colin Furze for giving me the tools to
seek out my revenge you can see his
channel there and david and ryan from
electrical engineering for helping out
the guns you check out their channel
here and finally derek from beyond
slo-mo for giving me those epic slo-mo
shots his channel has a bunch of
beautiful videos and you can see if
there
Fruit ninja.
"Oh!"
"In Half!"
The idea that a human being can throw a playing card with this kind of power and accuracy is insane to me.
Look at that!
And while throwing cards isn't necessarily, My strong suit
I can design and build stuff so I made the world's first deadly powerful playing card machine gun.
So I'm gonna give you a quick overview of the design and performance of my machine
And then to really test it out I'm gonna go head-to-head Man vs Machine
In a series of challenges against the best card thrower in the world. Here we go.
So to start off you load a deck of cards in the bottom right here
and then there's really two parts to the gun
First you want to slide the cards forward one at a time from the top of the deck underneath
That's what this belt and pulley are for.
And by turning this variable resistor we can adjust the feed speed
and then for the second part you've got this main wheel with oring stretched around
that's attached to this brushless DC motor
The cards are pushed under the wheel and it contacts on the left side and it spins them out underneath like this
It works because there's a gap under the spinning wheel
That's just barely smaller than the thickness of a single card and to build it as usual first
We started in CAD then machined the main body out of aluminum c-channel after that
It was just a matter of putting it together and running a lot of tests
and so this is what it looks like running in single-shot mode
And then machine gun mode
And then Robin Hood mode
And perhaps my favorite part is if you want extra stability you just push this button
I think I'm happy enough with how its performing at this point
So now it's time for the real test and to do that
I tracked down a man who could throw a playing card through just about anything
Rick Smith jr.
So how many World Records do you hold Rick?
I hold three Guinness Book World Records throwing a playing card the far that's 72 yards 92 miles an hour the highest and
considered the most accurate
All right. So in order to objectively test how good this really is
I am challenging the best the human race has to offer three rounds man
Versus machine. [Rick] Let's do this. This is like a metaphor. Yeah it is
How do you feel with all of humanity's hopes and dreams resting squarely on your shoulders? [Rick] Really worried about this? This is pretty impressive
I will say it looks I think a little more intimidating that it is this highly over-engineered. [Rick] Is it?
No, no
Let's go
Okay round one man versus machine, okay
How many cards could you do the styrofoam in six seconds?
Six seconds? Got plenty of room
I got this.
This is a machine gun.
Start!
And time!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
9 in six seconds!
I'll time you. Ready?
Well, I didn't want to introduce this yet. Just right out of the gate, but
[Rick] What is that?
Go!
8, 9, 10, 11, 12!
Oh
Even though I beat him in the first of our three rounds Rick said he'd show me a few of his trick shots.
Round two! Are you ready? Right now? I just want to say.
Machines - 1 Humanity - 0
Well, this is about accuracy as your machine accurate as it is fast
even more accurate than it is fast, but all
I'll prove that to you. I throw the olive up one chance.
One chance. slice of clean power
Got it.
Wow!
Completely in half.
Am I nervous?
No?
All right! Time for the machine.
Let's go!
"Do you know that close?"
"It's not close at all!"
"Things gonna mean something. Dude."
"You switch the olives"
"I did not"
That's fine. 1 - 1 I guess.
Oh my god! That scared me
I want you to think of a playing card any playing card on them? We've been playing with cards all day long.
Yeah, awesome
Name that card now!
That's a common card you sure you want that card. Yeah. All right. This is an ASIS play. That's my business card
I don't know why that's in there. But you really want the ASA spades. You could change it if you'd like. I don't
[Rick] What you're changing it to?
Three of clubs. [Rick] I knew he would. Look at this.
You look through the cards like this. Look look look, you'll see that one card and one card only is different
It happens to be the three of clubs
Stop! [Rick] Was that it?
So cool
My mind just broke. I hate you so much. [Rick] I'm so sorry. The world is no longer true.
It's witchcraft!
And to help calm my very troubled mind before the final showdown I decided we should blow some stuff up. [Rick] Guys ready?
And the physics at play here is pretty straightforward
If you've ever put your hand out the window of a car
You know what happens if you barely angle it up or down. So to fly fast you want to be perfectly level
there's this sweet spot right in the middle when I covered the science of the perfect rock skip in another video we talked about how
Spinning things are more stable because of Newton's first law
So Rick really flicks his wrist to maximize the card rotation
Which keeps it stable and level slicing through the air much longer than anyone else on the planet. All right, Rick Smith jr
All right Mark Rober. This is the last competition. Okay. What are we doing? First one is sticking in watermelon wins
That should be easy one. Try. There's the one catch the cool little twist is we have to shoot under the waterfall
Okay. All right. So you're gonna give us a countdown. I'll count down this is it man versus machine?
Is it this?
Over-engineered NASA piece of junk or the collegiate baseball throwing guinness world record card thrower.Place your bets in the comments below
Just don't forget to take this into consideration
When I count to three, I'm three, yep one
NOO! I'm out! [Rick]You're out?
And so while the robot uprising is undeniably marching closer everyday
At least for the time being Rick Smith jr. has our back
If you want to learn how to throw cards like Rick Smith jr. He actually put up a tutorial video on his channel
It's actually a super teachable skill because I started out like this
and less than five minutes later I was doing this so
Go check that out and sub his channel for more cool magic and card trick shots Rick
Could we go maybe a little thinner on those slices Pal?
We are in the kitchen right now because I'm about to make a dinner using hellofresh
I used to think I hated to cook but it turns out I just hate picking a recipe and grocery shopping
And so now when I get home from work, I throw on an audiobook and enter my happy place
We tried two other meal kit services
But the reason we liked hellofresh the best is because not only are the meals really good but the recipe is always six simple steps
With pictures for each that take about 30 minutes to make and when the recipe calls for one teaspoon of chopped parsley
You don't have to buy this and let it rot in your fridge for the next month
You get all the right amounts pre measured out and hella first starts at $6.99 per serving which is why it's the most popular meal
Kit in America, so if you want to level up your life with easy inexpensive
Home-cooked meals you can get started with six meals free. That's two free meals in each of your first three boxes

That's good
Thanks for watching
Hard through just about anything
And another go ahead it's do that so you dog
this guy stole my package and he's about
to open it in his house but what he
doesn't know is that this is a new and
improved custom-built bait package that
is recording him on four different
cameras that just released a pound of
the world's finest glitter along with
some other nasty surprises but to
understand how we got to this point we
need to go back one and a half years
because that's when someone stole a
package from my porch and the police
wouldn't do anything about it even with
the video footage which made me sad and
so drawing inspiration from one of my
childhood heroes I decided to make a
bait package to lure would-be thieves
and the Internet seem to like it but
despite my best efforts 1.7 million
packages are either stolen or go missing
every day hello Macaulay Culkin I'm
sorry it's just that home alone was the
entire inspiration for the glitter bomb
no no that's cool I love that just I do
other things with my life like run my
website bunny ears calm but seriously
though your design was good but actually
I think I even get a little bit better
and so if we call yourself my friend
Shawn and I have literally spent the
last 10 months designing building and
testing a new and improved design for
2019 so today I'm gonna walk you through
all the upgrades and then show you what
happens when you unleash ten of these
bait packages on random suburban porches
all across America we started with a
complete redesign of the box to make it
more streamlined and secure for contrast
last year's design was a bit of a rat's
nest the fundamentals are still the same
or you have a battery-powered custom
printed circuit board on the bottom that
has a built-in accelerometer so it can
sense when it's been jostled and then it
tells these four phones to start
recording and these are wide-angle
lenses so as you can see you'll be able
to record the thief no matter which side
they open it from and then right here we
have some fart spray but we added a
second bottle this year so as both these
motors spin cams around not only does it
spray twice as much but we changed the
formula this time around and it is
wretched dude
oh it's in my mouth man I feel like
hitches a turd never done that to be
clear and just to prove how much worse
it was I sprayed last year's formula
labeled a and then this year's formula
labeled B for 10 different people
without telling them which was which
alton independently agreed
this year's was much worse and then we
keep spraying it every 30 seconds to
ensure they get rid of the package out
of their house before they realize
there's four phones inside this
increases our chances of recovering it
since we already know the package
location at all times due to the GPS
tracking on all the phones but even if
we somehow don't recover it all these
phones have LTE data plans so they'll
upload their footage to the cloud right
away so then we can see what happened
and then we have the main course which
is the spinning cup powered by a motor
underneath here which we fill with the
finest glitter we could find which is
actually biodegradable this year as a
nod to our good friend Mother Earth we
also added sound effects this year so
after both the glitter and the fart
spray have successfully deployed we
start counting down five four three
nothing actually happens at the end but
they won't know that and then finally
after that we added some fake police
scanner chatter just because it seemed
like the right thing to do so as you can
see once you slip this cover over it
becomes nearly impossible to access the
phones now without special tools and so
finally we've got the lid which has
these two holes here which we cover with
one-way film so we can record the
outside world even when the lid is on
and you'll notice that this is a total
custom print these are the fictitious
Buzz 700s named of course after Kevin's
older brother and the thieves took just
two seconds to actually inspect the
package they would see
all the words on the side are just
slightly modified quotes from home alone
in addition to this amazing testimonial
and so then we just slapped on a fake
shipping label and used a random barcode
sticker to cover up the nightly charging
port and we were good to go so the idea
is the bad guy comes sneaking by and
then steals it off the porch and then
when they eventually remove the lid a
magnet taped inside triggers this Hall
effect sensor which tells a circuit
board brain it's go time and everything
is set in motion and as far as I'm
concerned relatively harmless karmic
justice has never looked so beautiful
[Music]
and so now all that was left was to find
porches for all the boxes so I sent out
a call to all my followers on social
media and we received over 400
applicants who have all dealt with
repeated package thefts in the past and
then from that we narrowed the list down
to just a handful and soon we had
packages out all over the country we
also set up a website so I could sit in
my Batcave here and monitor all the
boxes to see their current locations
record states battery phone levels and
even check the camera feed on any box at
any time and things started out a bit
rocky when we got a notification that
the first box was stolen and then we
noticed it was intermittently moving all
throughout the city so while we were
trying to locate it we checked the feed
and realized a UPS driver was so
convinced the package was real he
scanned it and picked it up and it was
riding around in his truck
next when someone else picked up the box
we didn't have the lid seal fully worked
out yet so as they were walking around
glitter started to spill out there's
glare coming out of it
yo Nick which is as they say it's
totally a scam when you open it it's
gonna explode with glitter this lady
took it off a porch put open it upside
down as soon as she heard the countdown
timer though she rushed it back to the
porch he stole it from just in a time
for nothing to happen but then the
thefts began to pile up and we started
hitting our stride
my god hurry sequence initiated
[Music]
operation super nasty fat initiated 1514
[Music]
after we tracked down this package and
recovered it by the dumpster we walked
by the store and they were sweeping and
spring Febreze which felt amazing
[Music]
deltad initiated and in the middle of
all this something happened that I still
can't wrap my head around one of the
volunteers we sent a package to who
obviously knows my channel and follows
me on social media who I even
interviewed to make sure he seemed legit
decided it would be a good idea to steal
my package from me and never had any
intention of either putting it out on
his porch or sending it back to us after
a week of us being really nice and
trying to work with him he effectively
admitted as such and then blocked and
ghosted me and it's just like bro
if you're gonna steal from someone don't
pick the dude who just spent a year and
a half of his life avenging theft of a
$5 Amazon package if I'm willing to get
that petty over something I could easily
reorder what do you think I'm gonna do
to the guy who steals the outcome of
that year and a half of work I quit my
job at NASA to make youtube videos and I
only make 12 of them a year so I have
plenty of time and I love to obsess over
these little details well that's even
though this is more of a science channel
than a prank Channel I love coming up
with these ideas like when I took this
Freddy Krueger action figure and taped
it to the back of my wife's car right in
front of the backup camera
[Applause]
and so after a little detective work I
discovered he gave us his real name and
phone number but he shipped it to his
buddy's address so I found his real
address and then did two relatively
harmless things the first is I've heard
once the Scientologists have your
contact info and know you're even
remotely interested they will follow you
the rest of your life and so since I had
all his contact info hypothetically I
might have gone on their website and
said I was very interested in learning
more and then I ordered $300 worth of
their starting course material so they
know he's a very high-value contact
worth keeping track of and the second
thing was I'd assigned over 10 custom
postcards just for him for example he's
from Texas so I thought a thank you note
for his $500 donation to Texans for
Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign
would be nice or this registration
confirmation for the upcoming furry
convention but the trick is while I
addressed it in his name I went on
Google Maps and looked like his
neighbor's addresses and hypothetically
I might have accidentally sent them to a
random assortment of houses around him a
lot of these are great because it's the
exact type of thing where the more you
deny it the more guilty you look so some
of these will inevitably be
hand-delivered to his mailbox by his
neighbors who spot the air and he'll
always be second guessing just how many
more there were and who's silently
judging him at the neighborhood potluck
now I want to mention we encountered
good people out in the world too who are
trying to actually keep our boxes from
being stolen
for example this woman did that but even
still the package was stolen just thirty
minutes later by a professional porch
pirate who knew exactly how to cover up
her face but then we said a holdup roll
that tape back unbelievably she has the
same body type and owns the exact same
shoes and pants as that Good Samaritan
so we turned the footage over to the
police to see if they too could
appreciate the coincidence and it just
goes to show you that your conception of
who a porch pirate is might be totally
off I'm just kidding this was a super
nice lady who took the package in for
her neighbor but it got us thinking and
instead of just always punishing the bad
guys we wanted to try and reward the
good guys so in some cases we left it by
an apartment mailbox and we change the
label to a real name and left tons of
contact information like phone number
and email all over the label and quite a
few people took the package back to
their house but instead of opening
they called to tell us they had our
package because they were worried
someone else would take it and so
instead of glitter and fart spray I gave
them four hundred dollars because that
was the opportunity cost for them when
they made the right choice thank you for
being one of the good ones then others
however didn't make the call
[Applause]
sound is one of my favorite physics
topics to discuss because it becomes so
much easier to understand if you just
have the right mental model the key is
to understand that the air all around us
is a fluid like water just way less
dense for example you could see the loud
sound waves coming from the revolver
Destin is shooting here my friends
opposed supported this video so I
created a simple demo to show the
fundamentals of how they're able to
achieve the insane amounts of noise
cancellation in their headphones I'll
first turn on this speaker that is
playing a tone of 500 Hertz you could
hear it in this mic then if I turn on a
second speaker playing the same tone the
waves will combine just like two waves
crossing in the water and it will be
twice as loud but if I reverse the
polarity on one of the speakers it will
flip the wave upside down and now
instead of combining the waves will
cancel each other out and the sound is
much quieter than if only one of the
speaker's was on this is the principle
behind how they achieve noise canceling
like in the headphone 700s here they
measure and then playback a flipped
pressure wave of the jet engine which is
why it goes so quiet and it's really
hard to demonstrate this without trying
it on yourself but this should give you
an idea of what their engineers are
capable of this leafblower this is what
my voice sounds like on the camera mic
but if you were to come
this is exactly what my voice would
sound like these things are just the
best especially when traveling they've
got a battery life of up to 20 hours
which has always been way more than
enough for me but even if the battery
somehow dies you could still use them as
passive wired headphones they have a
touch sensitive side to control your
music without pulling out your phone or
you could use voice commands with Alexa
Google assistant or Siri and perhaps the
coolest feature is conversation mode
which uses six mics to pass in all the
sound around you to give you superpower
hearing so you can actually talk to
people without needing to take your
headphones off and of course in addition
to add phones Bose has speakers such as
the s1 here or they're smart portable
home speaker both of which are cultura
portable after charging I really do love
these things and I use them all the time
so thanks to votes for making the
coolest possible gifts you can give some
of this holiday season and thanks to you
for watching
[Music]
What is the scientifically proven best way to skip a rock?
This is kind of hard to figure out
because every rock you throw is a little different,
not to mention your throwing motion might accidentally vary in between throws.
So to solve that I built a perfect rock skipping robot with my nieces and nephews.
So today I'm going to show you how we used what we learned from the perfect robot
to improve their throws on average from 3 to 13 skips.
Let's get started.
This is Lake Cavanaugh, it's located here in Washington State.
I came here every summer for a few weeks as a kid growing up.
and my memory of it is just this magical place to be outdoors and to be with family,
but to also discover my independence.
And of course to find a way to compete in anything,
[laughing]
including rock skipping.
And this is my first time back in 15 years,
so to commemorate that I wanted to build something really cool.
So we took a clay pigeon thrower and tweaked the spring,
and machined an adapter plate,
and then made some custom throwing arms from wood.
Then we created a base for stability.
And now all that was left
was to challenge my nieces and nephews
to a rock skipping contest.
Only I might have neglected
to tell them about my creation.
Actually forget this
[Surprised Yells]
You guys ready?
3... 2... 1...
[Spring Releases]
[Mark Cheering]
[Others Cheering]
So it actually wasn't that impressive right out of the gate.
But that was intentional,
because for this video I wanted to pull back the curtain
on some secrets about the engineering design process.
There are four steps I follow for any big project I've ever built
on this channel or in real life.
The first is research.
I will go online and look at any published papers
watch any videos on the topic
and then talk via Skype or email with any experts I could find.
That usually gives me a rough idea of where to start
and so the next step is to build a prototype.
A good prototype is cheap
and easy to reconfigure,
so you can try a lot of different things.
And then step three is to do
a sensitivity analysis with the prototype.
That means we try lots of different combinations
of settings to see what actually matters
and what doesn't.
And only at that point
are we ready to take what we've learned and move to step 4
which is building the final version.
[ting noise]
[screaming]
So often people want to jump straight to step 4
which usually won't work,
but it's almost worse if it does,
because you have no confidence
that you're close to the optimal design.
For the rock skipping robot
I'd already done steps 1 and 2
so we all sat down and
brainstormed about step 3
and all the things we could tweak
to find the right conditions for the perfect skip.
Eventually we came up with 4 different things to test,
but before we did that I was told
the robot needed to look a lot cooler.
[Music]
With the mission clearly accomplished
here are the four variables we decided to test.
The first was wrist angle of the robot.
This will change the angle of the rock relative to the water,
as you can see here.
So should it be perfectly flat?
Or really steep?
Or something in between?
Next was finding the right arm angle.
This changes the angle of the path of the rock
relative to the water.
So is this better?
Or is this better?
Or is something in between.
The last two variables had to do with the rocks,
but since every rock is going to be unique,
we needed a way to control this,
so we decided to make our own rocks
out of unfired clay.
That allowed us to make lots of samples
and to see how many more skips you would get
if you varied either the diameter or the thickness.
If you ever seen a primitive technology video
you know clay is just dirt and water.
This is great because it means it has a similar density to a rock,
and if you dry it in the Sun it's hard like a rock,
but then it only takes about 30 minutes
to totally dissolve away once you put it in the water.
Then we set up a testing plan
and for each throw we would change only one thing
and then count the number of skips.
That way if we suddenly saw a huge improvement
we'd know it'd be from the thing that we just changed.
That's where having a robot
is way better than using a human,
because it allows you to independently change one thing at a time.
And so as you can imagine we had a lot of skips that look like this...
or this...
or this [Scream]
But then we started to narrow in on some key parameters
and then they started to look...
more like this.
[Cheering]
[More Cheering]
[Music]
[Spring Clicks]
[More Music]
And I'm not exactly sure you count all those little skips the end,
but depending on that I would think we got some throws well into the 60's.
[Music]
And so in the end
we discovered there are four steps
to achieving the perfect rock skip.
The first is that you want the angle of your rock
relative to the water
to be about twenty degrees.
This is the optimal angle to allow the rock
to sort of crash into the water and then to make a ramp
and then use its forward momentum to ride up that ramp
and shoot back up out of the water.
And that's the exact physics that explains why rocks skip.
Next you want the path of your rock relative to the water surface
to be about twenty degrees.
This means you sort of need to start to throw high
which gives you some potential energy
to put into the system.
In the same way a ball bounce from this height will bounce more times
than a ball bounce from here.
Now before making this video
I assumed you wanted to throw
as low and parallel to the water as possible
like this,
but actually the ideal throw
looks something more like this.
Here's the guy who holds the world record in rock skipping
throwing from a bridge,
to demonstrate you don't need a super low throw to the water
to have it skip.
The third key is to flick the rock your wrist as much as possible
to get it spinning.
As you know
spinning things are more stable.
This is because they have angular momentum
and resist having it changed
according to Newton's first law.
So spinning and therefore stability is important
because it will maintain that magic
20 degree ramp angle with the water
as you can see here.
If it's not spinning enough it will rotate over
and then sink.
And finally rock choice is important
but not in the way I originally thought.
Primarily, it just needs to be flat on the bottom
to create that ramp.
but shape and diameter don't matter nearly as much.
The heavier the better because you put more energy into the system,
but not so big
that you can't reach the terminal velocity of your arm
by the time you release the rock.
This is especially important for kids.
They'll see much more success with small lightweight rocks.
And I should also mention that we looped back and checked
a couple of papers we discovered about rock skipping
and for the most part it matched
really closely to what we discovered ourselves.
And so armed with our new knowledge,
I put all the nieces and nephews through rock skip boot camp
to get the perfect technique into their muscle memories.
And while it started a bit rough,
they all eventually graduated.
[Music]
And the clay discs tended to be a little more forgiving
so we trained with those first,
and then graduated to actual rocks
and the principles translated perfectly.
And so after a hard workout,
like all true performance athletes,
we carb loaded.
[Music]
So there you have it.
In addition to learning to skip rocks like a pro,
hopefully you picked up some tips on the engineering design process.
People ask me all the time
"I have an egg drop competition coming up. Here are the materials I can use. What's the best solution?"
I don't know.
No one does,
without running some tests.
Because it depends on the actual rules of the competition
or maybe the brand of materials you chose
or how you actually put it together.
So you should do some googling for inspiration
and then make a bunch of prototypes
and do small changes on each to see what matters and what doesn't.
And only then go back and build your final version with some confidence
that you're gonna dominate the competition.
Last time I went to China, I learned two things
first the hearty pancake breakfast is poorly named
and second
I couldn't access Netflix or YouTube
or any of the sites I normally go to
unless I was using NordVPN,
who also just happened to be supporting this video.
If you travel internationally VPN is a must
but it's also important at home too.
As you know VPN stands for virtual private network.
So you could surf the web anonymously,
your location stays private,
and all your data is encrypted.
And even though I'm not a bad guy with something to hide,
I generate a ton of data online every day,
which I would prefer not to be used against me,
like a lot of the news stories you hear lately.
And as a bonus if you ever get a message about content not being available in your country,
hypothetically, with just a click of a mouse
your computer can teleport to anywhere in the world.
It's me, Mario!
And NordVPN is the best
because it's super easy to set up and to use
and super fast with thousands of servers across the globe.
They also have Apple and Android apps for mobile browsing that are free with your account.
So if you travel, or if you're just ready to start taking your privacy more seriously,
you go to NordVPN.com/MarkRober
or use the link of the video description for
77 percent off their three-year plan.
Which works out to less than three bucks a month.
So, it's NordVPN.com/MarkRober
and you promo code MarkRober at checkout
so they know I sent you.
Thanks for watching.

This is a rocket-powered Golf Club.
Professional golfers have an average swing speed of 110 miles per hour.
But using two F sized motors she swings at a hundred and fifty miles per hour, every time. Usually for builds on my channel
I just show you guys the final thing and don't really talk about the process of how we got there.
But rest assured, today, we will get to see huge drives,
WOAH!
golf balls shattering glass in super slow-mo,
pulverized watermelons,
and even a handheld version.
But this build, I think, is a great chance to pull back the curtain and demonstrate how the engineering design process actually works.
I want to highlight six-
"Learning opportunities" that led us to this final design and to do that,
We need to go back in time four months to when I first had the idea.
And as always we started with a simple
Prototype to see if the concept even had a remote chance of working.
Before we fire it up, you'll notice we have counterweights on the opposite side here.
That's so that the center of mass of the spinning part is on top of the axis of rotation. In other words,
It balances perfectly at the point at which it spins around.
If you don't do that for something that spins it creates a bunch of extra force for your system to deal with. It starts as a small vibration,
But then it gets worse and worse as you pick up speed.
Since we needed to hit this tiny ball with the head of this club at really high speeds, if we're not perfectly balanced, the club and
the whole platform itself will just be shaking all over the place and we'd never hit it. OK, back to the test
Those stands are shaking more than they should so we knew we would need to balance the spinning part better for the real test
But at least we knew it could go kind of fast and nothing blows up
And so then it was time for CAD
Which is always the next step and then together with my friends, Ken and Kayla. We started cutting metal and making stuff
Things came together well
so we epoxied a 3d printed motor mount to the top of the driver and prepped our first real test by taking one of
Those easy ups and draping some nets on the side for safety just in case something went catastrophically wrong
This was our second learning experience, we didn't have enough contact area for epoxying the head to the driver
So it wasn't a strong enough bond
this was tricky because it meant we had to 3d scan the club head which allowed us to CAD up and then 3d print a
more contoured mount with more contact area for the epoxy
We also took this chance to double the rocket holsters because what could possibly go wrong?
So we went to test our new dual rocket set up with two e motors and everything went perfectly
Except for the part where the head snapped off the driver
And when we reviewed the slow-mo footage what we realized was the shaft of the driver is so flexible that it would start to bend
And then create really weird thrust vectors for the Rockets which then just bent the shaft even more
This is not what you want to see. Eventually it succeeded the stress limit of the shaft and the head just came off
So our third learning opportunity was to stiffen up the club shaft
So we got some aluminum c-channel and just dumped a butt ton of epoxy in there and this worked remarkably
Well, you can see the difference here. And so with that we headed out to a very remote shooting location in beautiful, Northern, California
So we finally arrived and started to set up but first I have something I wanted to get off my chest
so one of the things I like most about me is that I will I
Like to reach out to lesser known channels and sort of give them a hand out at some exposure on my channel
Which is why today I'm here with Destin
And Smarter Every Day and if by some miracle you don't know Destin is on the Mount Rushmore
Of science youtubers we've been friends for almost exactly six years
and I know this because I took a screenshot of the huge moment for me when he subscribed to my channel when I only had
10,000 subs he's made videos about the physics of cats landing on their feet, tattoos in super slow-mo or the first video
I saw of him about how chickens have an internal open feedback loop which allows them to head track if you've never seen his stuff
I'm actually jealous because you have so many hours of high-quality viewing in your near future
So I like golf. I like Rockets
Should we do this? Yeah, let's just... That that was the intro right? That was it. Whatever
so we all continued to set up and something that was important to me was for this to look as natural as possible at a
driving range so we added some turf to cover the base plate and then
Dissected a golf bag to cover the sturdy steel column and then if you add some clubs it looks pretty awesome
It's incredibly rigid and yet it can still swing freely
Our fourth learning experience came from reviewing our final test footage if you listen, the club goes faster and faster with each rotation
Naturally we want the club to contact the ball when it's going the fastest which in our case is ten rotations in one second that
Means we somehow need to sneak the ball into the path of the driver in less than a tenth of a second or a quarter
Of an eyeblink to accomplish this we have a pneumatic cylinder here that hinges up the tee
It knows when to fire because on the back of the shaft
There's a light sensor and this disc has a slit which allows the light to pass through once per rotation
So we send that info to an Arduino over here that counts for us and then after 15
rotations
it tells the cylinder the precise moment to fire using a solenoid and
then we superglue the ball to the tee because it provides the
Goldilocks amount of force to first secure and then release the ball plus the superglue looks super dope in slow-mo
So now with everything in place we started with two e motors which is a
Reminder is the same setup that ripped the club head off three two, one roll
Where'd it go? What happened?
YEAH, BABY!!
No way
that's a cool shot right there. it is
Dude this is uh, this is respectable
This is legit after reviewing more of the high-speed footage. We noticed something interesting
The sound effect there is like "doy yoy yoy"
This was an interesting technical observation from Destin and that tee flexibility was causing us to hit some bad shots like this
The obvious fix is just to make the tee more rigid so that it doesn't over rotate when it pops up
But there's a problem with this
There's a saying that force follows stiffness and for us a really stiff tee would transfer a bunch of force and destroy our nice 3d
printed pop-up mechanism
Now imagine this crumpled up piece of paper is the tee which is obviously way less stiff
Our flexible rubber tee was great because it acted like this piece of paper no matter how hard you hit it
The force doesn't get translated down and damage our hardware
So Ken had the brilliant idea of just tying a string to the tee and staking it into the ground
This stopped the over-rotation but everything was still just as flexible when the string pulls tight
does it make the ball fly off because it's it doesn't doink enough? Uh, the only way to test is the doink test
Ah, beautiful there was some doinkage
I just thought this was a really simple clever idea that solved both problems at once and as you can see it worked perfectly
Now we are ready to try a dual F motor
So these deliver about twice as much force to the club as the e motors that made the head snap off and this
Provided our final and certainly most poignant learning opportunity. 3 2 1 go
Where's the club
It's, it's, is the tree on fire?  Wow, like I'm laughing, but that could have been bad
There we go, this thing was like sub-orbital dude. So we have three u-bolts and we only used two
Yeah
So I think we'll just max out those and just crank them way down now that we know this is a failure point
Now that we know this is a failure point
There's several failure points and I hear you say, oh we have a solution for that
This is the engineering design process!!
Rather fun. Like I mentioned the club that failed was cut too short and was only attached using two u-bolts
Which we thought would have been enough to support the 800 pound load from centrifugal force
We did notice the rubber handle was worn due to so many test fires which probably initiated the stress concentration leading to the failure
So our fix was to cut the next Club longer so we could use three
u-bolts and really crank them down on a fresh rubber handle and so with all six of our learnings now in place we tried the
Insane double F motors one more time
WOAH!!
YEAH, BABY!! GO!!
THAT's how you play golf!
That's our best one yet!
Dude.
Like the rush you get from like an engineering achievement actually working in like.
Seriously dude.
Oh look at the flame. OH yeah!
So we never found these long balls to measure the exact distance
But I can drive a ball 280 yards and these were well beyond that. I mean just look at this trajectory
straight to outer space
Now that we've got all the shots we needed it was time to have some real fun
We started with a handheld version that was powered by a single C motor because anything more than that would just be way too unsafe
For me to hold
Ni-ice! [unintelligible] over 300 yards man!
It really did
Like make it so much easier to swing I'm not even kidding. Yeah. Yeah
yeah, like it really meant different 3 2 and then some glass just because
YEAHH!
And then keeping with the tradition of my channel some watermelon
Thanks for cutting open a watermelon with a rocket-powered golf club Mark. You're welcome
Yeah, that's all of this the past three months of work in engineering was just for this
Boils down to this moment just to enjoy this watermelon. Yeah, Mark's like trying to make stuff look good
We're not wasting food though
we waste no part of the engineering effort like the great Indians with the Buffalo so Destin made a video on his channel about why some
balls bounce high and others
Don't and my first thought was well that's easy just has to do with how compressible or rubbery it is
Yet this billiard ball is pretty much completely
Solid and this bouncy ball is pretty rubbery and yet they bounce to pretty much the same height
So it's something else. As you can imagine this is a pretty important piece of information for golf ball makers
so there's lots of amazing slow-mo footage of golf balls being
Squished in ways that hurt your brain plus way more footage from today's shoot
So I will leave a link in the video description
And while you're there make sure to check out some of his other videos and subscribe to his channel because he's just a classy individual
And a true professional in every sense of the word. Are you rolling? Yeah
Hi, it's me mark
If you want to make your own rocket powered golf club
You can find all the CAD files and the parts list even the code for the Arduino on a website
I created called Mark Rober build instructions dot com and on that site
You'll actually see build
Instructions for tons of videos from my channel including my workbench and it's all for free and made possible by my friends at Wix.com
And my personal design aesthetic is simple and clean. So I used a template to get me close to what I wanted
But then I was able to customize it as much as I wanted from there
And this is great for me because I get a lot of questions about the builds on this channel and now I'm able to just point
People to one spot and because Wix is on the ball, it automatically looks amazing on mobile
Plus, it's SEO optimized
If you're looking for people to find your site through Google and my website is just a simple way to communicate information
but you can make one for your personal brand or
Portfolio or maybe a new website for your business to sell stuff online
Or even book appointments right there and it's free to sign up to start designing and publishing plus

[awesome montage]
what is up you guys this is terrifying I
actually don't like public speaking I
usually say no because it makes me
nervous so the idea of going live to
some amount of subscribers or people I
told them I don't want to know how many
people are on because that would just
freak me out more
yeah but it's good to be here I'll tell
you why I'm doing this in a little bit
but for today the question we're gonna
answer is why does helium raise your
voice we all know if I do this this is
live it breaks your voice go really high
wait a second that's not right because
this is sulfur hexafluoride it actually
does the opposite of helium it makes
your voice low so we're going to discuss
that and here it starts to wear off it's
like still in my lungs
why does sulfur hexafluoride make your
voice go view alone and yeah helium
makes it go really hot what the heck is
going on there so today we're gonna sort
of these science sleuths and we're gonna
figure this out okay and this is like
losing all the helium who cares get out
here we're live so the way that's gonna
work is each class will start with the
question like I said we'll go through
the clues to answer it so it's kind of
gonna be like a magic trick I'm gonna
take some negative information that's in
my brain and I'm gonna magically and
wirelessly transfer it through that
camera through your computer phone into
your brain
all right and I'm kind of excited this
is like what gets me most pumped about
science and education is these aha
moments so this is the first day of
class so I'm gonna start with a little
bit of groundwork a syllabus kind of to
sort of tell you guys the structure of
how I want to do these so first of all
the question is like why
the heck am i doing this well teaching
high school physics is like my dream job
that's what I'm actually getting my
teaching credentials right now and so
this is sort of an opportunity to just
sort of jump in with two feet and you
know probably not otherwise it's thing
the first time you like teach a class to
do it to like some large number of
people which I'm not letting them tell
me how many are on all right but right
we're doing this thing so of course
she's like I have my videos why do I
need to do this and the answer is this
is a little bit more personal it's a
little bit more fluid and a little bit
more interactive we have the chat over
there so at the end you guys can ask
questions and I'll answer a couple
questions at the end of every class so
each of these classes will be about 15
minutes long I'll do them like three
times a week Monday Wednesday Friday at
1:00 p.m. and then the last five minutes
will kind of be a QA so questions you
guys asked her in the chat I'll look at
them and I'll answer a couple of them
this won't be alike I said each time
also we'll have a question that we're
ansel answer and we'll go through some
cool physics principles sort of stepping
through together so this won't be a
replacement for your actual science
class unfortunately this is just you
know an opportunity for me to share my
passion with you guys but also it just
felt with like given everything that's
going on right now and the uncertainty
and the fact that you guys are home from
school it didn't feel right to me to
just put up like one ten minute video a
month and that'd be it
I feel like at this moment more than any
we need a little bit more connection so
that's the goal here you guys deserve
some sense of normalcy so I'm gonna try
and give you that three times a week and
I promise to do this for at least two
weeks so six classes and then we can see
how it's going and sort of assess you
guys are liking it and it's working and
I haven't made it on like livestream
fails like more than four times
I'll count that success and potentially
we'll keep going with this this also
isn't going to be like a tip
local science demo where it's like Oh
Mentos and Coke or like you know
elephant toothpaste the same stuff you
see like the science expert go on the
Today Show and they do the same thing
over and over on all the shows I feel
like those are exciting and cool to look
at but the science becomes sort of like
an afterthought and I want the science
to be more at like the heart of it
because you guys can understand that and
it can be really exciting so I think
with that oh the other thing I do want
to mention is that the challenge I have
here today is like I've heard from
five-year-olds who you know parents are
like I'm so stoked to watch with my
five-year-old it's gonna be really
exciting I've also heard from dudes with
PhDs who are like oh I'm so stoked this
gonna be really exciting that puts me in
a challenging situation because like
where do I strike the balance right on
what topics to hit so my goal is to more
like update your mental model we're
gonna talk generally about principles
less about specific facts to memorize
and that's more helpful anyways for
going out in the real world and applying
these principles so this is kind of
gonna be high school physics level but
if you sort of understand the math or
the science in my videos it's gonna be
about the same level all right so we're
gonna we're just gonna give it a chance
and and yeah let's see how it goes
so helium it makes your voice go higher
but why and I love love that word why
kids ask it a lot right because they're
trying to understand the world around
them and some people say you know if you
know how photosynthesis works it sort of
takes the magic out of it but I feel
like it's the opposite like I can
appreciate the beauty of a tree but if I
know and I'm looking at a massive
redwood it's beautiful visually but if I
also know that it's like dude those
things power up their energy from the
Sun they use that photosynthesis they
take the carbon dioxide of the air they
use that to rip it apart and that carbon
that they steal out of the air is what
makes them bigger their carbon vacuums
we've talked about that
video like that's beautiful and then
when I look at a tree and I see holy
crud that's a look at all that carbon it
sucked out of the air and I know
generally how that happens that's like a
dual level of understanding and and the
beauty of nature around you and if you
could have that understanding about a
lot of things not just trees the world
is so much more of a cooler place so
that's what we're gonna try and do today
all right so helium our first clue to
uncovering why not just that helium
makes your voice higher but why is air
the fluid alright that's your first
important mental model and that seems
weird what do you mean the ears are
fluid there's no fluid fluid is like
water right it is it's just super not
dense okay
so let me show you a video here and
we're gonna switch over and by the way
this I'll get that in a second all right
so you see this ice tray right ice the
air around that is cold becomes more
dense it kind of sinks and you see the
soldering iron over there the air around
that and never play that again is hot
it's less dense and it kind of floats
but look at this like this is usually
schlieren imaging allows you kind of see
the air currents that's fascinating
right here's another one from my buddy
Destin from smarter every day this is a
gun that's firing in super slow motion
those are pressure waves you see doesn't
that look just like a pebble going into
a pond you see it rippling out like that
so here's a demo I've got we'll switch
back live by the way this is going to be
super rough with like switching cameras
like we forget built this set in like 12
hours yesterday so bear with us air is a
fluid so here's the sulfur hexafluoride
check
this out someone is like constructing
something outside I'm gonna light this
flame upside down which makes my finger
real hot so I'm going to turn on the
sulfur hexafluoride and you can't see
this it's looking like nothing what I'm
doing right now is I'm filling this
container with this heavy liquid right
it's happening okay so it's filling up
this cup that might be good I'm going to
bring it over here and pour it into this
cup what do you think might happen
whoo it almost didn't go out I was gonna
have to blow it out and cheap I did
laughter all right so let's pull back
wide so what the heck just happened
there what what happened is like this
sulfur hexafluoride is a lack of oxygen
fire needs oxygen
we poured that liquid into here it
filled this up it's heavier than air so
pushed it out right in the same way oil
is heavier than water and it goes to the
bottom and the water sinks up so that
starved the flame of oxygen and it died
in fact the biggest use for sulfur
hexafluoride in industry is in really
high voltage like control rooms so that
it doesn't arc and and cause a spark so
they put this stuff in those rooms to
make it more safe so you can't have an
arc and a big explosion all right
air is a fluid so think about what
happens if you drop a pebble in a pond
you see ripples right you see waves that
go out so that brings us to our second
clue sound travels through air in ways
in the same way that you know if you
drop a pebble in a pond you see waves
that go out from where you drop the
pedal so if I blow on the back of my
hand right I can feel that I feel the
pressure
on the back of my hand a fun experiment
we didn't have time to said that we got
a leaf blower here with parent's
permission now you're like stuck inside
if you guys have a leaf blower blow that
on your face film it in slow-mo with
like your iPhone and play that back
hours of fun it's amazing that's I would
really feel the pressure from that air
right well your eardrums which is
simulated by this thing right here they
sense like you sense pressure on the
back your hand from blowing on it they
sense pressure in the air like a million
times more sensitive than the back your
hand so little vibrations in the air
they can sense so when you talk what's
happening is your vocal cords are they
punch into the air into your throat and
then it hits the air molecules in your
throat and then all the way up and a
chain reaction all the way to the person
across the room those air molecules are
crashing into each other and their
eardrum moves and the louder it is the
more it moves in if you are saying
talking or singing in a high frequency
like ah right versus low higher
frequency higher pitch just means those
vibrations are happening more frequently
so about a hundred and eighty times a
second with a high pitch maybe a hundred
times a second for a low pitch I'm gonna
show you this demo right here to help
you understand this a little bit better
so this on the screen is a longitudinal
wave and what you can see here is that
these follow one individual particle
just like if you drop a pebble in a pond
the water molecule next to that rock
doesn't go shooting across the top of
the water think if you see a piece of
wood floating on top of a pond and a
pebble hits it that individual piece of
wood moves a little bit but it doesn't
fly across the pond right it's the same
thing here so the air molecules kind of
stay where they're at they just crash
into each other and then if they crash
so here's that determines the
wavelengths where you kind of see that
the tops of those waves right and so
again if that thing on the left was
moving quicker those wavelengths would
be closer that's a higher frequency
okay so the next thing we'll kind of
discuss then is I'll just go straight to
this you can see on the computer so this
is I made the world's largest air horn
with Lincoln and Dan from what's inside
and this is how we intro to it ignore it
it's that behind you now you can look
[Music]
[Laughter]
okay so here is we could say on this
demo or on this screen in that same
video I sort of explained what I just
talked about so here's me kind of
reviewing the same concept just in a
little different words I use jello too
of course let's say this jello block
represents a volume of air molecules if
that horn diaphragm hits the jello
molecules over here there's a chain
reaction of jello molecules crashing
into each other until finally you see
movement on the other side of the jello
block and this is where your eardrum is
so it moves back and forth at the same
rate as the horn diaphragm because of
all of these collisions of the jello
molecules in between this is called a
pressure wave and it's how sound travels
through air and so if the horn diaphragm
is heating the air molecules at a high
frequency or very frequently our brain
decodes that of a high punch but if the
crashes are happening at a low frequency
or less frequently than our brain
decodes that as a low pitch so we had
with that big horn we had it like two
and a half miles away and I'll show that
clip in a second and we had walkie
talkies and we said okay can fire the
horn what do you think happened maybe if
you've seen the video you remember but
the sound didn't come to us right away
why is that
well should make more sense right now
right because you have these molecules
crashing together this is why sound
travels slower than light because sound
actually needs things just crash into
each other before it reaches you and the
greater the distance the more that's
exacerbated so here's what actually
happened this should make a little bit
more sense now that you've got a little
bit of an updated mental model on sound
so the horn is now super far away I
literally can't see it with my naked eye
it's so far away I can barely see it
it's right at the crest of the hill
there's a little tiny speck and it's
right there we're gonna do an experiment
and we're gonna test the speed of sound
we should hear it on this walkie-talkie
and then some amount of time later we
might be able to hear it from this
distance Lincoln's gonna measure the
time on his stopwatch and then we should
be able to calculate from there what the
Veta sound is we're ready when you are
[Music]
crazy it took 11 seconds for the sound
of the horn to get here it's so clear
like I feel like we can go 10 miles
further think about what this means
it took an unbroken chain of two and
half miles of air molecules 11 seconds
to all collide with each other until
they made it all the way down here and
bumped into the air molecules in our ear
canals which then bumped into our
eardrums I just like that end part there
with Lincoln that's funny so now with
this mental model
now think about lightning and thunder
well why is it you see lightning and the
Thunder is delayed well first of all
thunder is frickin amazing because did
you know that's a sonic boom Thunder is
a sonic boom basically the air around
the lightning bolt becomes so hot and
superheated that it expands super fast
it goes faster than the speed of sound
which is by definition a sonic boom so
that's what you hear the reason there's
a delay it's like five seconds for every
mile or something in freedom units I
know it is in kilometers America is
because the sound needs to crash into
each other right the light you see
immediately electromagnetic waves it
comes to your light speed of light much
quicker right so this mental model will
also help you understand the Doppler
effect have you heard of the Doppler
effect well this is when you kind of a
siren goes by and it's one pitch coming
at you and when it leaves it's a
different pitch now think about which
should be the higher frequency in the
lower frequency remember the car was
stationary and honked his horn it
wouldn't matter but the fact that the
car is moving what does that do with the
weight here's a really good video that
helps explain that
so first of all here's an example so it
starts at a high pitch and moves to a
lower pitch even though from the drivers
perspective of the horn is playing the
same pitch the entire time so what's
going on as the vehicles coming towards
you the sound waves that it's a meeting
bunch up and so I delivered to you at a
frequency which you interpret as a
higher pitch because the frequency of
sound waves is pitch and then when the
vehicle passes you and is moving away
from you the sound waves spread out and
so you hear them at a lower frequency a
lower pitch all right so what's cool
about this that should hopefully make
sense right because the cars moving the
waves on the front are more compressed
they're happening more frequently higher
frequency higher pitch the waves on the
back are more spaced apart lower
frequency lower pitch right what's
really cool about that this isn't just
true for sound it's also true for light
which is one of the main reasons we know
that the Big Bang occurred is because
when we look at all the stars they
should be a certain color but they're
all shifted the frequency is a little
bit lower than what they should be which
means everything is moving away from us
and now you might being like whoa hold
on everything's moving away from us does
that mean we're at the center of the
universe a good mental model for that is
like no it just means everything's
expanding I just put this black dot on
this balloon from the reference point of
that black dot when I blow up that
balloon
everything is moving away from that dot
so that's the same thing this universe
is getting bigger and bigger expanding
expanding we know that because all the
stars are red shifted red is a frequency
that is lower which means everything is
moving away from us which is super cool
okay this is the juicy part all right if
if I've lost you somehow this is where
it all comes together and just
it's beautiful for us answering why does
helium raise your voice now that you've
got rating the right mental model okay
heavier things are harder to lose wow
this is really heavy all right now this
is a big shocker right if I want to move
this as fast as I can
using the muslim' arm I can move it
about that past this hammer is a lot
lighter see how much faster I can move
that same muscle same force it just goes
faster because it's lighter okay I
promise we won't do a lot of equations
but here's one if you're in physics you
know this force equals mass times
acceleration those are fancy words you
don't need to really know it that much
but if your force is the same okay same
size F and I make that time the eggs
gotta get really big right to stay
balanced you can think of this like a
teeter totter you have an eighth grader
on one side and two third graders on the
other side if you swap one of those
third graders for seventh grader it's
gonna weigh more well to keep that
teeter totter balanced
you got to swap that other thirty Gator
for like a kindergartener right so both
these things are true do you want us the
equation to stay balanced if you make
the M really big the a the accelerations
got to get tiny all that's to say this
equation is basically explaining this
the force is the same the muscles in my
arm if you make the mass way bigger how
much I can accelerate this goes down
accelerate it means just like making
something move have a change in velocity
if you make the mass smaller look how
fast I can move that okay here we go
we're getting to the punchline this is
exciting I have three balloons here I
want you to guess which is filled with
which okay we'll start
with the easy one the fact that this is
taped should give you a clue hopefully
this doesn't break in my break I'm just
gonna pull the tape off okay we get into
the good part
okay what's gonna happen here peace out
balloon that was the helium what's gonna
happen here that could put in the normal
balloon and let's see whoa look at this
thing doesn't that look funny it's cuz
this has the sulfur hexafluoride in it
if I can put the camera which I won't
the helium is up there
this is the sulfur hexafluoride which is
heavier the sulfur hexafluoride is
heavier it's heavier than normal air
check this out
ready one two see how much quicker that
fell and the helium you know is lighter
it went up so what's your brain thinking
you put it all together you have all the
pieces at this point the mental model
should be there what happens is because
the helium weighs less you put it into
your throat and it's right there and you
speak and your vocal cords push against
it they're like I got this same vocal
cord same this is my vocal cord same
force it can move it back and forth
really fast really frequently higher
frequency higher pitch conversely with
this over hexafluoride
here's your vocal cords same force
they're like dude this is what I've got
I'm doing my most muscles heavier thing
acceleration goes down it moves those
back and forth and pushes on them less
frequency lower frequency lower pitch
mic drop science y'all that's exciting
that's cool so now that you guys have
this mental model it's gonna allow you
to understand things the fact we know
air is a fluid means the Doppler effect
can make more sense means thunder and
lightning makes more sense means now you
can explain to everyone else and impress
them that you know that helium I'm out
of breath
makes your voice higher my sulfur
hexafluoride would go make it go lower
ultimately it comes down to those
molecules are just lighter for helium so
your vocal cords could push push on them
really fast lighter things are easier to
move just like harder things are hard to
move higher frequency higher pitch
alright
so that's kind of where we are what just
happened there was a magic trick the
best kind of magic trick a negative
knowledge for my brain just widely
transferred through the camera into your
brain and you have a better
understanding of what happening you need
to watch some of that back that's cool
even if you only stood part of it that's
cool too
we planted the seed so don't get
discouraged if not all that made sense
ok so I'm gonna end with these things
with the question from the next class so
you guys can start thinking about it
in fact I'll probably have some prizes
for people who can answer the question
right but before I do that let's see
hold on so the Horde sorry let's not
show that screen yet okay before I do
that I just want to end with something
actually don't go to this computer
you're not on this computer right
there's a surprise I don't want you guys
to see it
can you hear the audio all right Rhianna
I'm gonna end with this thought so you
got to do the typical marker over this
now feels like a marker over video right
feeling it okay you guys feeling this
like this is like a live video a big
part of what I'm doing this is you guys
are like the future of our country of
the world you are future scientists and
engineers and doctors and artists and
this is tough like I get how this would
be really tough right now and so with
everything going on I felt like it was
the least I could do to kind of check in
and make sure that you guys we're doing
okay a little bit weird I totally get
that so I kind of want to be here more
often
so I was thinking like three times a
week would feel about right I want you
guys to know that like I'm taking this
very seriously social distancing stuff
this is the real deal
however having said that like it's going
to be bumpy but I know that we'll get
through this and that as a global
community I said this in my last video
we're gonna come out stronger we're
gonna be better for having gone through
this the most successful people I know
are those that can take their life
challenges and see them as opportunities
so do me a favor and find out how you
are gonna freakin punch coronavirus in
the face what are you doing to friggin
take this opportunity and just take
control of it right for me that meant
you know I'm ditching the once a month
format this may totally bomb my channel
and kill in the algorithm but I don't
care this is a cool opportunity to learn
to teach we a couple buddies helped me
set this set up yesterday in like six
hours this is really rough this was
brutal
wasn't super smooth but you know what
I'm doing what I can
maybe you wanted to learn to play the
guitar or learn a new language right
what an opportunity you've got on top of
doing your school work to try something
like that maybe you have anxiety right
mental health is a very real thing it's
just as important as physical health so
maybe for you that just means you've got
to get through every day one foot in
front of the other but this gives you an
opportunity to practice some of those
coping skills you shouldn't be ashamed
maybe it's you know my dad told me he
was out for a walk he's got a little bit
of gray hair an older gentleman he saw
someone loading groceries into the car
and they turned to him and they're like
you know do you do you want me to get
you for some groceries right okay I
can't get emotional you guys cannot I
don't want to become a meme on my first
last year they offered to get him
groceries right because they didn't want
him to have to risk himself total
stranger that's punching coronavirus in
the face what can you do to step it up
and to go above and beyond and be you
know a source of light for someone else
so take this seriously there's no need
to panic we totally got this together we
got this we can do this all right so
with that I'm gonna show you the last
question in fact part of this is I want
to sort of give a shout out to other
youtubers so every week the person who's
gonna introduce the next question is
sort of an up-and-coming youtuber or
someone who maybe you've never heard of
that I think you should see their
channel so here's the channel of someone
probably haven't heard of him but you
should give his channel a try what's up
students i'm mr. Bies this is my partner
in crime Chandler and my buddy mark
Grover you know we did TVs together he
asked me to give you
a question for your next class so here's
my question I thought long and hard and
this is it okay mark if I fart do I lose
weight or do I gamely what happens like
generally you know what happens to my
weight when I fart I want to yep
Chandler thought about whatever I'll see
you guys in the next class
all right mr. V's fine maybe you've
heard so that's what we're gonna talk
about next week
right that's the question I want you
guys to think about that in the same
just like this week I'm gonna give you
three clues we're gonna update our
mental models of the world and you're
gonna be able to answer that question
and everyone's gonna love you cuz you're
gonna be so smart
so with that there'll be a link in this
video once it's uploaded you can click
on that and you can answer you can take
a guess at this question I'll pick
someone who I feel like gives the best
most concise answer we may be having
surprises both talked about having like
headphones I could give out to people
who get it right each week or each three
times a week so officially with that
thank you guys so much for attending
I'll say class is dismissed
if you want to stick around after the
bell I'm gonna do just a few minutes of
Q&A so this is a chance each time I
generally don't do a lot of interaction
so this is your guys opportunity to ask
me questions and all and I'll answer
them so thank you so much for attending
a little bit of QA you're officially
dismissed you won't get in trouble if
you leave right now and yeah this is
great okay so okay for Michael Garvey he
asked is sulfur hexafluoride toxic and
the answer is no it's hard to get if
you're like oh I want to get some of
that because this is like a cool party
trick it's harder to get a bottle like
this is I don't know a couple hundred
bucks or something it lasts a long time
it's totally not toxic
just like helium isn't the danger is it
goes in your lungs and it's heavier than
air so it can stay in your lungs so if
you did a bunch in and you're breathing
in you're not gonna get as much air so
in worst case scenario you turn yourself
upside down and literally pour that gas
out of your lungs because it's magical
but yeah otherwise it's fine then why do
people have different sounding voices
says tuk soo ah no we I feel like just
like a substitute teacher
how many pronounce names here T lead
then why do people
voices let me ask you that tealy why do
you think people have different sounding
voices guess right now in the chat if
you think the answer is remember I said
this is my muscle these are my vocal
cords well the bigger your muscles I
don't have very big muscles but my man
Luke over here running camera he's got
big muscles he could push this hammer
faster than I could right he could push
this heavy thing faster than I could so
it's a function of just your vocal cords
and how those push air right and a bunch
of other things but simply put that's
just the fact that you're pushing air in
a little bit different speed than
someone else okay last question from
penguin nation I feel like you're like
pranking the sub and I have to say
penguin nation now I guess that's your
screen name penguin nation why can't my
friend hear me when I'm a mile away in
other words why does it not travel
further great question so because this
is actually a mechanical thing and
things are colliding right think if you
had a bunch of billiard balls you hit
the first billiard ball hits the first
one it is the second one it hits the
third one at some point it makes sense
those would stop colliding why well you
probably say there's friction on the
table it's felt mark obviously and their
sound or and there's you know you're
losing energy technically to heat and so
that's it it's just like a
non-conservative system so each of these
collisions gives off some energy and so
eventually there's no more energy for
the sound anticipate in addition there's
sort of an inverse square law rule thing
where the further you are away from me
the less of a percentage you're getting
of that energy right if you're really
close if you get all this the further
you go away this is a really big thing
you're getting a smaller sliver right
this is why it's harder to kick a field
goal from really far away versus really
close the further you are that angle
gets right so that's kind of the concept
it's those two things but basically I
think the bigger driver is just see how
all these collisions and you're losing
energy so good
questions this was so fun this is
exciting we did it we made it through I
don't think I didn't think I did well
beyond lifestream fails so that's a win
in my book class is officially dismissed
I will see you guys next Wednesday same
time find out if farting makes you a
less
[Music]
Hey
welcome back to science class with me
mark Rober so today we're just gonna
jump right into it class we're gonna
answer this question does farting make
you weigh less and I asked you guys this
question 70% of the people got it wrong
so I think we're gonna update some
mentals models of the world today which
is our goal we're not about memorizing
facts I want to give you guys principles
that helps you understand the physical
world around you so if you're new here
the format is Monday Wednesday Friday
1:00 p.m. Pacific yeah we start with the
question we get three clues we try to
unravel what the answer is by the end of
class and last time was my first one
everyone was really nice I got some very
good feedback where this is kind of
rough you should see the set looks a
little bit better this time last time
like the set this desk was still wet
with cement from having being painted
but we're figuring this out and yeah my
dream job is to be a high school physics
teacher I'm getting my credentials right
now so they won't let me teach yet so
life pro tip if you want to do something
don't do it for the first time in front
of 1.4 million people but uh coronavirus
here we are it is what it is and it was
fantastic I'm gonna talk more about that
later and about facing your fears up to
the music on and stuff once we're done
with all the science so the format here
about 15 minutes for the science and
then officially class would be dismissed
and then we'll do a Q&A at the end it's
more interactive than a normal video so
go ahead and ask questions if you want
and then I'll answer a few of them at
the end in five minutes and they give
you questions about the lesson or even
questions about me I don't do this very
much kind of interacting so if you have
personal questions anything is on the
table I just want to answer the ones I
don't
answer so there's that okay so to answer
the question just farting make you way
less let's start with another question
which is why does some stuff float while
other stuff sinks so the hammer sunk but
then this wooden block floated and that
brings us to clue number one which is
talking about this concept of density so
density is defined by how much you weigh
versus how much space you take up right
and I know you're a physics student your
life away it's actually mass difference
we mass and weight we'll get to that in
another lesson for now all the formulas
work everything works we just consider
this weight so how much you weigh
relative to how much space you take up
that's density so if you're less dense
than the fluid that you're in group
you're gonna float if you're more dense
than the fluid that you're in you're
gonna sink all right so I've got a hunk
of metal here and what's gonna happen it
sinks and you're like big whoop mark
metal sinks mind blown right I could
tell you're not impressed
so all right hotshot I want you to think
how can I is a brainteaser if I add more
metal to that metal how can I make it
float all I'm gonna do is add more metal
to this another hunk of metal here how
can I make it float you get the answer
right now I'll be super impressed put it
in the comments tell the person you're
next to okay
you lose a few more points the longer it
takes you but I'm gonna start doing this
okay you're thinking how can I add more
metal to make this thing float you
figured it out yet okay
what am I doing here metal metal it now
floats I basically made a boat which
allows us to create an alternative
ending to Titanic this is Jack I had to
make him a little more modest because he
didn't have pants on this morning that's
a duct-tape kilt okay how the king of
the world
is rose Jack why are you wearing a skirt
it's not a skirt it's a kilt
okay it floats look at that and it
floats so much I bet we could even add
more we're gonna add a I don't know this
mango it's still floating there's an
avocado the Titanic never let go there
it goes all right now it eventually sunk
but it could support a lot of weight I
know I just lost half the stream because
they're like what the heck can you do it
mark you've lost your mind
but let's just talk about boats for a
second like what the heck what some of
the boat boats have like you know cruise
lines have like gyms and pools on them
they're made of steel how do those
things float well the key okay
density clearly somehow they have to be
less dense than water otherwise they
wouldn't float we add up all the weight
the pools and the tracks and the water
slides and the steel relative to how
much space it takes up if you average
that out it is less dense than water
because think about all the open air and
that's their trick sure they've got a
steel hull but they've got so much air
in the middle and when you average that
out it actually is less dense than water
and it's closer to just wood right a
massive boat basically as the equivalent
density of a block of wood so a really
cool trick you could do here too is I've
got this tennis ball here you can see
the water line is about halfway up the
tennis ball
tells you that this ball is about half
as dense as waters the water is twice as
dense
if the waterline went up like 90% on the
ball then you would know that the tennis
ball is almost as dense as water but
it's 90% as dense right that's a cool
trick also I want to show you this if I
put this tennis ball at the bottom of
course it floats we're gonna come back
to that a little bit later that's really
there's a real cool clue kind of tucked
away in that so this allows you then to
well I should say this there's a dude
named Samuel plimsoll real smart guy
engineer in like the 1800s all these
ships kept capsizing so he did something
and he's like he did the math calculated
the density he painted this line on the
ships this is called a plimsoll line if
you've seen this red line on ships what
that line means is that you're allowed
to put cargo on there as soon as the
water level gets to that line you got to
stop loading it up if you put any more
on there then it is too heavy and the
ship is going to sink so he basically
did that and saved a bunch of lives
because ship people are like how how to
put a few more crates of this and they
would they would stand on the scale so
it wouldn't waver quite right but it's
like dude I don't care how you weight it
the water level is not above that you
can't have this ship go because it's too
dangerous so this provides us with a fun
game you've got a tub like this you
could fill it with water
it's called doesn't weigh more or less
than water or as David Letterman said
will it float so we could start easy
styrofoam I want you to make a guess in
the comment below or maybe tell someone
you're in the room with of what you
think it'll float or sink styrofoam I
guess that we're starting easy flow
simple so it's way less dense than water
right golf ball any golf ball golfers
out there well no it will sink can of
beans or you guys think sink all right
get a little harder
cucumber floater sink more or less dense
than water flow but it's
whoops you can see only a little bit
sticking up how about mango this is what
sunk our Titanic earlier we've got a
sinker okay avocado getting tricky like
I said sink or float hello but just
barely
okay four more can of Diet Coke floater
sink it floats sinks dun dun dun what
would make normal coke sink and Diet
Coke not sink I don't know for sure my
hypothesis would be there's like three
tablespoons of sugar in coke versus Diet
Coke so my guess is that just makes it
more dense than water peanut butter jar
peen about our float or sink sink oh it
floats but just barely and our final one
watermelon is it gonna float or sink Oh
watermelon floats ours ours
entertainment and we'll floaters think
okay now let's talk about that just a
little bit so think about like a fish
first of all it's really hard to be
neutrally buoyant that means like you
notice all of these are either on the
top surface or on the bottom right
floating in the middle is really hard
I'm gonna get to this later I have a
challenge to give you guys with regards
to that how does a fish do this how does
it go up and down right the answer is it
takes advantage of this density equation
fish are smart they can't change their
weight right they're not like gobbling
things up right in the middle of others
coming around so they they modify this
the space they take up
they have bladders that they kind of
stretch out yeah same weight but they're
taking up more volume what does that do
makes them less stands they go up no
like I kind of want to go down there and
check that out what do they do they pull
that in so they take up less space they
become more dense they go down right
it's very clever this also can help your
mental model then what's the purpose of
a lifejacket well a
life jacket doesn't weigh very much but
it gives you more volume more space so
you take the average of you including
this live jacket you are going to be
less dense which means relative to water
you're gonna float easier right if you
go into a pool and you hold your breath
and you're on the top surface you're
nice too sick a stick up there you let
that go your volume goes down and you
start to uni and then you start to sink
so this doesn't work just with water
this is true for any liquid or any fluid
and something in it so there's a channel
I like called Cody's lab and he did this
experiment with Mercury and an anvil it
doesn't seem to want to stay upright I
let it tip over this it's whoa look at
that the mercury that it's in well if
you remember from the tennis ball it's
floating about half way up so it's about
half as dense because that's where the
mercury line is right not the water line
so relative densities is one way to
thinking of this problem right that's
the simple way okay let's do a little
bit different way this is a little bit
more complex but it allows further
emphasized insight think of forces okay
forces you're like what's a force that's
a weird word forces like anything that
acts upon you right so think of like a
tug-of-war and right now there's the
force of gravity we all know about
gravity right I've got this gravity was
acting on that pin currently on me
there's a tug-of-war gravity's pulling
me down but what's keeping me up the
floor is pushing up with the same force
tug-of-war you know that it's a tie just
like in a real tug of war because the
middle is not moving right it's not
going one way or the other
however if I was standing on a trap door
in the trap door when and it's gone
guess who's all the sudden gonna win
that tug of war gravity is like you oink
I got this and I start to move down
that's when you know someone's winning
as you start to move so gravity is one
force that pulls on something that's
floating in water the other force is
clue number two the buoyancy force well
what is that don't worry about these
fancy words I'm about to say the
buoyancy force is equal to the fluid
surrounding fluid density times the
space you take up the volume times the
gravity so I'm building up to a point
that's about to blow your mind think
about being in a pool right the deeper
you go the more pressure you feel right
the lower you go your ears feel all
weird you kind of feel compressed a
little bit that's because you have all
this water above you weighing down on
you right the deeper you are it's like
oh you're really feeling it it's like
being the bottom person in a dog pile
that's not where you want to be there's
a dog pile I always try to be kind of
towards the top because you have less
people above you so there's this
gradient right the deeper you go the
more it is so if I'm in a pool there's
actually a little bit more force at my
feet than the top those all cancel out
and you're left with a net force kind of
pushing you up
that's a buoyancy force that will happen
anytime there's a pressure gradient so
more pressure at the bottom versus the
top right so this density force this is
you or the buoyancy force I mean if the
buoyancy force is less than the force of
gravity that's supposed to be an arrow
then you're going to sink that's what
happens with the can of beans for the
can of beans gravity wins that
tug-of-war the canopy's goes down
because the buoyancy force isn't enough
to keep it up however if the force due
to buoyancy is greater and the force due
to gravity who wins that tug-of-war the
buoyancy force does and that's what
happening with the diet coke or this
piece of styrofoam the buoyancy force is
greater it wins the tug-of-war and it
floats so here's the big moment what do
we talked about last time air is a fluid
right it's not like liquid it's a lot
less dead
but I'm basically in a fluid right now
and the higher you go there's less
pressure the lower you are there's more
pressure that's because there's just
more air above you pushing you down just
like in a swimming pool you know this is
true because if you have a bag of chips
you go up into the mountains it expands
right that's because there's less air
pushing out on it if you go up in an
airplane your ears hurt that's because
it's a freaking metal tube flying
through the air they're pressurizing it
to try and make it better on you but
they can't it's it's a leaky metal tube
and so you feel that difference because
the higher up you go there's less
pressure anything that has the gradient
pressure gradient will have a buoyancy
force ready for this so the fact that
this tennis ball when I push it down it
goes up like this right that is the
exact same principle brace yourself as a
helium balloon going up both are in
fluids this is just less dense we it's
like if you were a crab on the bottom of
the ocean floor and I put this tennis
ball next to you you would see it go up
we are like crabs on the bottom floor of
this ocean of air this is so poetic
and we see this balloon going up where's
it going it's going up because it's less
dense than the fluid around it right
here air is kind of pushing it up
because the gradient and it will keep
rising till it gets to the surface which
is where the the density of that helium
balloon is equal to the density of the
atmosphere because it gets less the
higher you go alright so hot air
balloons float because on average if you
take the basket and the people plus the
hot air which is less dense it's just
less dense than this ocean of air that
we're in right and it goes up so this
leads us to the final clue which is that
fights are less dense than air okay
now technically you have all the puzzle
pieces you need this one's a little
harder to connect but technically the
pieces are there I want you to think
about those puzzle pieces while I show
you this final clip that kind of
summarizes everything we learned this is
from a video I did
made a fluidized hot tub out of sand
floats in the sand and other stuff sinks
this has to do with the buoyancy force
which is a function of the density of
the surrounding fluid and the volume of
the object itself whenever an object
exists in a pressure gradient there are
forces from pressure pushing in on all
sides but they push a little bit harder
the deeper that you are which is why it
hurts more to be the bottom guy in a dog
pile or it hurts your ears more the
deeper you dive in the pool and this
makes sense because the deeper you dive
the more water there it's above you
pushing down and if you add up the size
and direction of all those arrows a
bunch of stuff cancels out and you're
left with one net force pointing
outwards that is the buoyancy force and
if your buoyancy force happens to be
greater than your force from gravity you
float and if your buoyancy force happens
to be less than the force from gravity
you sink now we usually think of
buoyancy with water but you can think of
things like helium balloons being
buoyant in our atmosphere so here's a
trick question which of these has a
higher buoyancy force it's actually the
rubber ball point see force has nothing
to do with the density of the object
just the volume so since the rubber ball
takes up more space it has a higher
buoyancy force but you might object then
why does the rubber ball sink and the
balloon floats remember it's a tug of
war the rubber ball sinks because the
force from gravity on the thick rubber
skin and the air inside is bigger than
the buoyancy force but for the balloon
even though it doesn't have as big of a
buoyancy force compared to the ball it
still floats up because that buoyancy
force is bigger than the weight arrow
from the helium and the thin rubber
shell and the helium will keep rising
like a ball floating up from deep in a
lake and then it will eventually hang
out where the density the atmosphere is
roughly equal to the density of the
helium in the balloon because that's
where the tug of war becomes equal we
made it through now back to my nephews
[Music]
that's my nephew Beckham he's watching
right now hello backup I love you
it's a tough love that was tough love
that's possibly my favorite clip of any
clip I've ever made on YouTube
he was fine even though it was like sand
eventually so we're gonna answer this
now we got all the puzzle pieces first
I'm gonna give you the grade-school
answer someone gave me this suggestion
and breaking it down into different
levels so the grade-school answer is if
I step on this scale and I'm holding
these balloons which are less dense than
the air around me right now if you take
my average density it's kind of like
wearing a life jacket what do you think
happens to my weight on the scale well
let's say I had 5000 balloons
fun fact at about five thousand balloons
someone like me would float kind of like
the movie up the more helium balloons
I'm holding the less that scale is going
to read conversely I have this heavy
weight here and more weight I'm holding
this this is more dense than the air
around me that scale is gonna read more
well that's scary to see that number
wait that's not right okay I weigh more
okay well we know from clue three farts
are less dense than air and so the
answer to does fartie make you a list
ladies and gentlemen because farts are
less dense than air it's like you're
holding a little fart and you poof let
it go and because of that that scale is
going to read a little bit more right so
farting makes you heavier so eat a lot
of beans to temporarily have that gas in
you it's a great weight loss program I
guess right farting makes you heavier
and that's the grade-school answer the
junior high answer middle school I'd say
after farting on average you're a little
bit more dense right because you were
holding that little helium balloon of
fart and so more dense things weigh down
more in this ocean of air that we're in
so you're gonna weigh a little bit more
the college answer is kind of look at
the tug of war between buoyancy and
gravity and if you look at the Delta V
volume of the little fart you let out
multiplied by the density the air around
you
that's like buoyancy x' participation
the volume of error times the density of
the gas inside you on that tug-of-war
buoyancy gives up more so gravity wins a
little bit more you're gonna weigh a
little bit more okay my favorite answer
though is the grade-school one right
farting weighs less than air so it's
kind of like you're holding some helium
balloons you let go you're gonna weigh
more did you catch that did you get the
wireless transfer of knowledge from my
brain through that camera in your phone
ears this is magic this is science
people this is good stuff this honestly
gets me stoked and pumped I love these
aha moments I love giving them to other
people hopefully you had one you can
rewatch it if you didn't so the winning
answers submitted by someone was la la
see you
I suck at names you guys have some hard
name to pronounce he says farts are
mostly methane which is lighter than air
so fart is like a helium leaking from a
balloon I like that it's very concise
and simple so I'm gonna start something
new I have a challenge for you guys cave
all want you to get a tub like this and
play will it float with your family or
just with yourself whatever and try and
find some tricky objects see if you guys
can keep score and trick each other then
what I want you to do is try and make
something neutrally buoyant so you could
take this block of wood and you could
take some washers or coins to it try and
get it to be neutrally buoyant like a
fish it's really hard so if you get a
good combination send it to me on either
Twitter or Instagram or Facebook and
I'll pick my favorite one and show it
next time the one that can last the
longest even if you get three or four
seconds that's pretty good
trust me this isn't that easy okay we're
gonna get to Friday's question but first
I'm gonna do a little moment so is where
I turn on the music and have a little
moment right this feels like you're and
I'm a marker over video now
I want to talk to you guys just for two
minutes about fear of failure so I
decided to do a livestream for the first
time in front of a bunch of people and
it wasn't super smooth but I kind of
loved that right I love this opportunity
to try and master something and to learn
and do it a little bit better next time
and that can be scary but that's also
how you learn it's like one of life's
best treasures it's having these
opportunities I gave a TED talk about
this called a super Mario effect and
it's basically when you play a video
game and you fall into the first pit
let's say Super Mario Brothers you're
not like oh I fell in the pit I'm so
ashamed I never want to do that again I
failed right no you're like oh shoot I
fell in that pit okay next time I come a
little bit higher I gotta jump a little
bit more coming up with more speed
people were like hey Mark great
livestream do you want some feedback I'm
like hey the sidewalk feedback that's
like playing Super Mario Brothers in one
level through two and you're like dude I
know how to get infinite you know extra
minute and I'd be like I don't tell me I
guess I want to know I want to get
better it and master this a lot of times
with our life challenges we say I just
don't want to try that because I might
fail and that's embarrassing to me right
so if you treat your life's challenges
like we treat video games and focus on
like beating the game versus focusing on
that I might fail you could be more
successful and have more fun and learn a
lot more so this is me punching
coronavirus in the face and just trying
something and if you think oh but mark
you're just a natural of this no go
watch my first youtube video I will link
it in the document below where you can
also guess on next week's question it's
bad you can see my improvement and I
giving this gift to you guys of watching
me and proving something so I can be
good enough to teach physics in the
classroom you guys are helping me hone
this in right alright so go watch that
TED talk if you need some inspiration
cuz you're like I got a punch
coronavirus in the face but I'm afraid I
don't know what to do
maybe that gonna help you push you over
the edge question for next time here we
go internet I'm known as the space gal
and mark I was hoping to get back down
to the basics so I had a question for
you why is this bad blow alright that's
my friend Emily she actually has a
Netflix show coming out this summer
where she kind of does experiments
around the house in fact right now she's
live-streaming every day on Instagram I
will link her YouTube video if you want
to cool do cool experiments in your
house that you could do which is junk
you have lying around your house go
check out her channel she's got some
really cool stuff she's awesome she's a
great science communicator so why is the
sky blue we're keeping it simple alright
that's next week and maybe you kind of
know that has something with frequency
I'm gonna give you a way to remember
that a mental model that's easier than
just like memorizing equations because
that's how we roll here alright so
officially class is dismissed link for
guessing how that works and other links
from stuff I talked about like Cody's
video will be in the youtube description
so you can check that out I'm gonna take
the last five minutes to answer
questions I see that I'm Way over time
again there's just too much cool science
I can't help it I'm sorry I really need
to make these shorter I'm trying bear
with me here we go so you're free to
leave classes officially dismissed I'll
just take the last five minutes answer
some question what is with the
watermelon theme on this channel I just
love watermelons they're beautiful
they're just cool they look great when
you explode them good question what did
you get your college degree in I did my
undergrad at BYU and mechanical
engineering I did grad school at USC
while I was working at
in mechanical engineering so I'm a
mechanical engineer a lot of the stuff I
do on my channel is kind of like a
mechanical engineer II and pppp pppp
when did you decided you want to be a
you teacher I just I honestly I crave
that feeling myself of having those aha
moments of like having a mental model
heirs of fluid and that helps me
understand everything around me when I
was in high school physics it something
just clicked for me and I was like oh
you can explain the world around you
with math and equations and I craved
that I loved I craved the feeling of
giving that like gift to other people so
that makes me want to teach I want to do
in the classroom because you get a
little bit more of that personal
feedback people like oh you could reach
a lot more people through youtube I mean
it's true but like I'm talking to a
camera right now in a room with two
people right in a room by the way that
has a couple of really cool robots for
world records that we're currently
working on I would turn the camera but I
don't want to give anything away
you guys might steal my ideas so yeah I
kind of want to do in the classroom so I
get like that selfishly kind of get that
feedback I get to see the eyes light up
I know it kind of happens sometimes here
there's something about seeing it in
real life do one more question okay from
all the questions like picker so hard to
pronounce mister Hughton what does the
pathway which took you in order to get
to NASA
when did you start planning I'll just
say real briefly and I on this note if
you don't know exactly what you want to
be when you grow up that's okay when
adults are like what's your 20 year plan
it's like I don't know nobody knows my
philosophy on this it's like crossing a
river if you see a stone in front of you
you kind of step on it and then once
you're on that one you kind of wiggle a
few more stones with your toes and it's
like oh that one's the most stable I
like that one I'm gonna jump on that one
right the key is just to dominate at
every level you are just do your best
try your hardest
SuperMario effect and then that will
just open more pathways for you I got
lucky I put my resume literally in a
stack of resumes and they happen to pick
mine it was like excellent timing so for
me to tell you oh this is how you get to
NASA cuz oh I did it would be like hey I
won the lotto the trick for picking the
winning
lotto numbers is like choose your
cousin's birthdays right it's like just
my philosophy would just be like just
dominate wherever you're at if you're in
high school try your hardest the harder
you try the more you learn the more
opportunities you have if you want to
paint paint like crazy paint a ton and
then you'll get better and then you'll
have more opportunities and it will lead
to other the other cool things and it's
just a fulfilling way to live life so
that's it class is officially dismissed
I'll get the outro music and we'll see
you guys next time
and my guy who is supposed to bring in
the thing at the end is a little slow
[Music]
[Applause]
Hey
welcome back it's good to be here I'm
Mark Rover this is science class so
today why is the sky blue and maybe in
your head you're like like blue light
scatters you just memorize that fact but
you should know by now we're not about
facts here this is about mental models
let's get a good mental model of why
it's blue because that's more useful you
could extrapolate and you just have a
deeper level of understanding so as
usual we have a question we have three
clues by the end of this we should
understand it better and we use a few
equations as possible so why am I doing
this because yeah my review of the
coronavirus is zero out of five stars
this is kind of a bummer you guys are
home from school it didn't really feel
right to just not you know do monthly
videos so I'm just trying to do
something so we connect a little more
give you guys a little sense of normalcy
in your life now I have to start with
something I'm very ashamed of as you
might know my last video was about
washing your hands and how you can
transmit viruses by touching things and
most importantly the important why you
gotta wash your hands is we tend to
touch our face so you shouldn't touch
your face this is the exhaust port on
the Death Star
your eyes your nose your mouth having
said that well let's just roll the tape
I'm not proud of this out of the gate
I'm not proud of this
beans cucumber mango avocado regards to
that density equates start to sink four
so just a little bit the gravity you go
your ears there's this that's a verse
and it floats leave classes this isn't
that easy yeah so less than twenty seven
is my goal today you guys can keep me
honest alright I'm really gonna do a
better job I picked this topic because
to be honest I didn't have a good mental
model of it and so I basically give
myself a day to learn something really
deeply so then I could turn and explain
it simply you cannot explain something
simply until you understand it well so
this turns out is a little bit more
complex than last week but I don't think
it's too complex I think you guys can
get this and we're gonna make it happen
today the last thing I'll say is I could
mess up here this is live we built this
set it's a miracle we're here right now
I won't get into it it's been a crazy
morning things could come crashing down
if they do we roll with it I might miss
speak and say something a little bit off
if I do I mean I decided I'm gonna in
the video description I'll put any
corrections afterwards but I appreciate
your patience I basically have a day to
come up with these things but the lesson
plans are and it's fast and loose and
we're live so as an example last I
forgot to state the assumption on the
fart one that you know your intestines
aren't under pressure that's like was
one of the premises I wanted to state
that makes you that's the reason makes
you heavier so things like that check
back to video description in a few days
and if you're like I don't think that
was right I'll try and tweak it in
general you can trust me but things just
might be a little off cuz it's fast and
loose okay why is the sky blue
we're just get right into it clue number
one electro magnetic waves you're like
what's that electromagnetic waves are
radio waves Wi-Fi your microwave your
cell phone that you talk on these are
electromagnetic waves they're all around
us but we can't see most of them right
so what's really cool and crazy about
these though is the only difference
between like x-rays and microwaves and
radio waves is the wavelength so picture
I have a slinky here the more I stretch
out the slinky the greater the
wavelength right if I count the little
rings the Rings
they're less frequent so it's a it's a
lower frequency right lower pitch like
with sound there's a lot of analogies
here if I stretch this pretty close
slinky closer together the Rings happen
more frequently higher frequency
right and the wavelength is smaller so
what if I told you that there was a
specialized instrument that you can use
to actually sense electromagnetic waves
and it's within like a foot of you right
now there's a specialized instrument for
sensing electromagnetic waves and maybe
you're like no there's not
I'm on the couch the TV's way over there
I'm not by anything electronic it's not
electronic it's biological and you have
two of them and they're in your head is
your eyes
these are electromagnetic wave sensors
and you're like what are you talking
about and I'm telling you like these
eyes you look around it's like that is
400 nanometers it's telling you the
wavelength and you're like that is 700
nanometers and you're like I don't get
that feedback and you do as a lot of you
probably know now in colors colors are
your brains way of telling you different
electromagnetic waves that are coming
off things and hitting your eyes so
here's a chart that will come in on and
here's you know big wavelengths radio
waves these can be like as big as cities
in their wavelength that's a stretched
out spring slinky all the way to really
really tiny gamma rays x-rays now
there's this little barrel band here the
visible spectrum is what we call it from
about 700 to 400 nanometers red orange
yellow green blue purple it's the
rainbow what's interesting about this is
that if you go infrared we can't see
infrared but some animals can like
snakes right or mosquitoes or bedbugs
now why would blood sucking insects why
is it helpful for them to see infrared
well if you've ever seen him for red you
could see body heat so they find their
victims right on this end of the
spectrum ultraviolet ultraviolet like
extra violet infra red because Reds over
here ultraviolet you have like
butterflies and elk they can actually
see this they use our reindeer they use
it to navigate bees as well so our eyes
a specific range but other animals can
see more okay so that's clue number one
electromagnetic waves just know that
your eyes are eyes allow us to see a
certain spectrum right here and we see
those as colors alright number two clue
number two the Sun okay
so the sun's just like amazing I give
the Sun a five out of five stars
unlike coronavirus and the Sun blasts
this whole range of electromagnetic
waves it's not just a certain way
everything at all times it's like just
blasting us all across the spectrum it's
like one trillion nuclear bombs a second
is the energy coming from the Sun it's
93 million miles away which means it
takes 8 minutes and 20 seconds for the
Sun to reach us so I am setting a timer
for 8 minutes and 15 seconds because
that means right now a photon just left
the Sun it's on its way here so in 8
minutes we're all gonna celebrate and be
like yo welcome to earth photon like
welcome what a journey you just made 93
million miles away it's on its way we're
gonna come back to that in a second
that's gonna be exciting it's Naruto
running its way right here real fast
alright so we're gonna check in with
that the Sun is all of the colors so we
see it as white right the Sun kind of
looks up it looks white basically but
that means that's because when you
combine all the colors it's white then
you may have seen this I'll come over
here with the prism maybe you've seen
like a chandelier in your room where it
hits some glass and it splits it out
that's when it's giving you the clue
that you know it actually has all those
colors in there at when it when you see
that it's kind of unpacking them for you
so the other thing to point out is the
color you see is the color that's
actually reflected so it's saying that
certain wavelength red is about 700
nanometers that's the wavelength that's
hitting my eyeball not the color that's
absorbed if I see green that's closer to
500
that's the wavelength of electromagnetic
that's hitting my eyeball so here's a
question if you have a plant you love
this point it's your favorite plant you
want it to live I give you one choice of
color to shine on it day and night what
color do you choose remember green
plants are green
if you chose green your plants dead you
killed your plan
that's really sad I put an F in the
comments in the chat for your plant
it's dead why because remember the color
you see is what's reflected so green is
the one wavelength that plants like
don't need right they're sending that
back any other color it would get more
nutrients and be able to do
photosynthesis but Green is the one it
doesn't need so that's kind of a little
helpful sort of mental model so you
should know also black absorbs all the
colors white reflects all the colors
this is why unlike a hot day if you're
wearing a t-shirt a black shirt gets
hotter than a white shirt because whites
like reflecting other colors black is
absorbing you want further proof I will
I've got this flashlight here right so
let's pretend this was a red flashlight
we have to use our coronavirus
imaginations because I wasn't able to
actually get a red flashlight in time if
I shine a red flashlight on this what
color is it
the paper's black if I shine a green
flashlight on this what colors the paper
become it's black it sucks all those
colors it's like whatever you send at me
I'm sucking it in I'm staying black now
let's say white if I had a red
flashlight it was a dark room and I
shined it on this what color does this
paper look it looks perfectly red if I
had a green flashlight and I shine on
this what color does this paper look it
looks perfectly green so white is like
yo I'm a color mirror whatever you throw
at me I'm just gonna balance back
exactly what you sent at me so that's
why we're in right now in this room all
the colors of the spectrum you hear it
hitting it it's like I'll send them all
back at you baby and it's gonna look
white because of that because that's the
color when you combine it together so
one thing that's kind of interesting to
think of is a blue marker isn't really
like
Oh a blue marker it's kind of like a
blue blocking marker right I just put
some liquid on this paper that's really
good at blocking the blue
electromagnetic wave so it's like I'm
gonna block these and send them back at
your eyeball so it's not really a blue
marker actually all right so that brings
us to clue them through the sky
okay what is the sky when we say the sky
we're kind of talking about the
atmosphere what is the atmosphere here's
the globe there's like a layer around
here that's like 80% nitrogen 20% oxygen
right and you might say well what would
it look like if we didn't have an
atmosphere and there are exactly 12
humans who have a first-hand account and
only 12 of what it looks like with their
own eyes to have be on a planet or a
celestial body with no atmosphere you
guess who that is the astronauts who
have walked on the moon because on the
moon you can see it's daylight there on
the moon but you could still see the
stars at night the sun's shining it's
just there's no atmosphere on the moon
the other benefit to that you come back
is that with the atmosphere it creates
friction so in asteroids come in that's
why the moon is so cratered with our
with our atmosphere the asteroids come
in you're really hot and they burn up so
they don't hit us usually on this a
really big RIT the dinosaurs all right
so that is the sky now let's talk about
we're things are about to get really
crazy so my favorite physics teacher
Paul Hewitt gave an analogy if we can
I'll bring this down all right here we
go
watch this okay high tech on our set
today so you could kind of make an
analogy of colors and the frequency in
the electromagnetic spectrum to sound
right
see if we can see this so something that
has a higher frequency is going to sound
it's small its tiny right and purple and
blue are just the end of the spectrum
where they have a higher frequency if
something has a lower frequency which is
red on the other end which means a
longer wavelength lower frequency less
frequent lower pitch you would expect
this to be really high or really low I
mean low compared to this right here the
difference so here's what's really cool
this is this is the cool mental model
here I'm getting this globe out of the
way the globe just broke
we've got Ken we brought him back
duct tape kilt ken that's you on the
surface of the earth this is the sky
okay and what you'll notice here is most
of the little pieces up here in the sky
are shorter chimes closer to this
because nitrogen and oxygen are really
lightweight right really lightweight so
they're gonna resonate with something
that has a much higher frequency so
here's the Sun when the Sun shines it
sends all of these colors at the same
time pretend this is above it kind of
goes off camera so pretend I'm perfectly
above I send the Sun all the colors what
happens is it's the higher it's those
little nitrogen and oxygen they're
lightweight that kind of resonate with
of all the colors they resonate most
with the higher frequency ones the blue
and then the violets especially the
violets and they scatter that light
because heavier molecules are much more
less calm and you see a long one here
it's like it's like ten times fewer
heavier ones than the light weight runs
most of what gets scattered is the blue
light so that's why the sky is blue at
noon when you're looking up you hit this
it's because all the particles up there
high in the sky are really lightweight
and they resonate with the higher
frequencies okay so that kind of helps
with our mental model but now that we do
have a mental model the question is what
happens at sunset
so now duct-tape kilt ken is over here
at sunset right the reason why that is
if I come to the board this is the
surface of the earth right this is kind
of the the atmosphere here it's thin
layer Oh welcome to earth there we go
there's the timer
it just came it just arrived so those
are the photons we talked about earlier
they're here look outside your window
welcome them
what a glorious moment okay so the Sun
right at noon it comes straight down it
doesn't have to go through my that much
atmosphere but at sunset what happens
when the sun's over here I've already
got it drawn here look how much
atmosphere it has to come you're over
here duct-tape kilt
ken is over here it has to go through a
lot more atmosphere so now this is the
situation here's Ken okay 10 G's up a
little higher here's the Sun Sun does
its thing sends all the frequencies
coming but what happens is that there's
so many more little of these chimes
coming that they run out of energy at
first it's like oh they're shining real
bright really loud the high-pitched but
by the time it gets over here there's
nothing left so all the blue and the
violet all that's left are the lower
frequencies the Reds and the oranges
right it's the leftovers basically which
is really interesting to think about so
when you're standing here at sunset the
reason that you see that is red and not
blue anymore is you have to go through
so many and all of the the higher
frequency there's no more energy left at
those wavelengths and so you're left you
get the leftovers of the longer ones and
now this mental model then helps us
think about why let's say in Arizona you
really beautiful blue skies or right
after it rains the sky looks really deep
blue well there's no pollution there's
no call it water moisture in the air
it's just those really lightweight
little chimes so resonate
really loudly at those and it's very
vibrant blue if there's a fire a lot of
pollution that's fine little particles
in the air and so the sunsets are
especially beautiful because they'll
blue light dude by the time it gets you
get out of town like there's no blue
light left at all it's all been totally
scattered because there's so many little
particles in the air right if there
actually is a fire going on you can
almost look at the Sun at noonday and it
looks Orange the reason you could do
that is because that blue light and it's
really dim don't look the Sun by the way
but I'm just saying those blue thing
those blue particles they've been
they've been scattered right so and then
I'd say one more thing about this that's
even you could expend this model even
more if you're in your bathroom and the
window fogs up right what happens is you
can't see it becomes opaque that's
scattering all the light instead of it
because you have heavy particles light
particles you got the whole range right
so a cloud or when it's foggy or hazy
those are like water droplets and
because you have all sorts of different
sizes in there not just a higher
concentration of smaller ones
it's just scattering everything and when
you scatter everything it's white okay
all right
so I'll end with this cool little
experiment this was a happy accident
last night it we checked it doesn't look
as good on this camera as it did for me
last night but this is basically a
sunset in a bottle up top I'm going to
show you now what I got at home because
it just shows that better than these
cameras but you can do this experiment
yourself all that's in here is just a
little bit of milk so that looks like
the noonday Sun right it's blue and
white
look at that white sun blue sky when I
move it down there's just a little bit
of milk in this beaker you get a sunset
so what's happening there well look at
that that's beautiful come back here
Alex what you're seeing is that up here
the the the beaker is more narrow so
there's fewer particles to go through as
you go down and expands out there's more
little particles for the blue to be
scattered off and all you're left with
is the is the longer wavelengths the
Reds and the oranges from my fly
how cool is that you can do that
yourself just a little bit of milk maybe
in different glasses alright so I think
that should be kind of powered through
that the wireless knowledge of transfer
from my brain hopefully some of the
stuff came through but hopefully some
stuff made sense there and you have a
better mental model of what's going on
so I want to show you guys some of the
great video submissions I got last time
with the neutral buoyancy thing before I
do I just want to say both saw what I
was doing and they said that they will
give away about eight of these seven
hundreds these are like their dopest
headphones they make you know they've
worked with me before I'm not getting
paid for this but they just said hey
we'll give them away so they're going to
give four away to anyone who tells
people about this class either on
Twitter or Instagram or Facebook or
tic-tock tic-tock is that the ticket I
will randomly pick someone who's telling
people about this class so we can get
more people here for people get that and
then for people who do who accept the
challenges or answer these questions and
do a good job you got to see some of
these responses we got here we go so
both will be reaching out to you if
you're one of the eight people they
selected for this week's challenge we'll
come back over here I love this quote
your shadow was confirmation that light
has traveled nearly 93 million miles
unobstructed only to be deprived from
reaching the ground in the final few
feet thanks to you so with this in mind
the challenge this time for next Monday
is to create some shadow art okay this
is where you find everyday objects
around your house and you kind of turn
off all of your lights in the room put a
single point of light on it and make
something cool now these are really
advanced so don't feel like you got to
get this crazy but get creative and you
know maybe spell something out see if
you can make a shape something cool that
you wouldn't see it looking at the
objects but when you shine it from a
certain angle it looks awesome so if you
want a Google to get some inspiration
it's called shadow art all right so I'm
gonna end with the question but first
this is my opportunity to say something
and for me the thing I want to talk
about this time real quickly is this
element of curiosity the most important
thing to say in science isn't Eureka I
have discovered this it's so last night
I had a moment like that with the
speaker I actually wanted a perfect
cylinder and then as I was like playing
around with this and seeing where we
find the best I realize I could like
actually create a the microwave was
discovered when someone was standing
next to a radar and a friggin mr.
Goodbar melted and this guy's pocket and
he's like that's interesting what's
going on there so that he observed that
and did more so don't be afraid to be
curious and to ask questions and observe
first step in the scientific method is
observation so that's how all great
discoveries are made by just observing
so pay attention to the world around you
touch my face and then good things will
happen so let's talk I'm going to show
you the question for next time from my
friend Sally oh hi mom
it's doc decided a patient and I was
wondering if you could help me answer a
question I've been struggling with how
can you put your hand in water without
it getting wet drink okay so put your
guests in the comments we're through the
comments below and by the way the answer
isn't like where a glove what are some
other creative ways you can keep your
hand
by the way sally has a PhD in
evolutionary biology from Oxford and
she's doing a live stream once a week
I'll put a link to her channel in the
video description
she started from the basics and going up
so it's really interesting uh all right
well with that say what a hot mess this
was and I love it this is beautiful
we're going to class is officially
dismissed as you know we're gonna go to
some questions and then I'll answer
these for like three minutes and then
you have your assignments the challenge
I'll see you guys next Monday okay so
here we go did you consider other
engineering paths because I enjoy
lecture cool engineering and I want to
know what you think you chose wrong I
mean it's as simple as that's a fact
mechanical engineering is the best I'm
just kidding I don't electrical
engineering is like in chemistry you're
like I can't see those things right
mechanical engineering is always just
really resonated with me it's like oh
there's there's this piece of chalk I
could tell you exactly how long till it
hits the ground right I could see the
things I like the interactions the
collisions so it's kind of whatever
clicks for you so for me that's what
clicked but you should do what you like
even if you choose the wrong one all
right what's the difference between
normal people are normal and colorblind
people so I should be careful on this
because I don't want to go too far out
of like what my expertise is colorblind
people don't see the world is like black
and white and like oh you get no
information of electromagnetic waves
they just see it off a little bit and
it's harder for them to distinguish has
to do with like the cones in our eyes
so like certain colors are harder to
tell the difference but it's not that
they see the world in like black and
white
[Music]
why do shadows appear darker if it
doesn't affect wavelength all right well
I have to okay I've got two more
questions I love the next one after this
okay I just got excited
why do shadows with your darker eye
shadow is just a lack of light right if
you have a white light you know in a
dark room so shadows are dark because
there's just there's no waves hitting
that spot if you turn off all the lights
in room it's plee dark that means
there's no electromagnetic waves in that
visible spectrum in that room all right
so a shadow is dark because it's just
like an absence of electromagnetic waves
hitting that spot last question why is
water blue from far away and transparent
close up basically why is water blue and
this one's cool because water actually
absorbs there's something about it were
absorbs infrared and wavelengths kind of
more in this spectrum so the reason
water looks blue is because it's like
sucking up and absorbing some of the
energy that's like more red and infrared
and so what happens if all that goes
away all that's left to bounce back is
the bluish greenish stuff so there we go
that's the lesson for this week thanks
for joining we'll see you on Monday
[Music]
welcome back to science class
I'm your host Mark Rover it's good to be
here it's a beautiful Monday so today
we're gonna be talking about how to
waterproof your hand and I think you can
make the argument your hand actually is
kind of waterproof we're talking about
like how you make it so it could come
out of water dry all right and as usual
to answer the question we have three
clues
to kind of help us get there and we use
as few equations as possible and we're
our goal here again is to not just
memorize facts we're about getting the
right mental model because with a mental
model you can understand the world law
better and you could extrapolate and
really have a good understanding of
everything that's going on in physical
around you so why are we doing this it's
coronavirus it's two thumbs down
I wanted a ability to connect with you
guys a little bit more plus I want to be
a high school physics teacher one day so
this is good practice for me I will I do
have an announcement there will not be
any class this Wednesday I apologize but
the good news is I still want to be
making normal videos right my monthly
video so I need to film for something
this Wednesday so no class on Wednesday
but we will have class on Friday all
right so last week last Friday was a
little abstract with like
electromagnetic waves and stuff so today
we're gonna get down to basics again
we've got some really cool demos that
you can do at home as well as the
science I think will be pretty simple to
understand so word is gonna get right
into it with clue number one of how
we're gonna do this cohesion that's a
fancy word what the heck does cohesion
mean let's pull in tight on this camera
and I'll show ya so I've got a paper
clip here and no big surprise when we
learned last Wednesday a paper clip is
made of steel it's more dense than water
of course it's gonna sink right but what
if I bent a paper clip like this and
then I lowered it a little slower
it is now floating on the water and
you're like what the heck mark my life
is a lie everything you told me last
week when we talked about buoyancy
should say those should sink right well
you probably know this from a common
term called surface tension right
there's some surface tension on the
water that's causing it to stay up let
me explain what's going on there so wait
I've got this snap I'm here sorry there
we go
okay now this is oxygen this is h2o two
hydrogen's one oxygen right so these are
attracted to each other because of
basically magnets positive and negative
forces well what happens when another
water molecule comes up like this this
is negatively charged this oxygen and
these white things the hydrogen they're
positively charged so what do you think
happens well it's like a magnet
they kind of come close and it's like
hey what's up and they kind of stay
close to each other and more water
molecules come and it sort of forms like
a magnetic net that is what is called
cohesion so here's a little diagram I've
got here this is like a mug of water
right all these blue things are water
molecules and that those black lines
represent the cohesion that's kind of
like the forces in between the molecules
now there's an air in this diagram see
if you can find it has to do with the
tug-of-war thing we talked about last
week you look at this top layer they're
being pulled down so like one take
example one in the middle it's equally
suspended all around so it wouldn't move
right it has a tug-of-war ropes being
pulled in all directions it's gonna stay
right where it's at we do look at this
top layer they're pulling side-to-side
okay so it won't move laterally but up
and down it's just being pulled down
there's nothing to pull it up so what's
gonna happen this these molecules are
neat they're gonna win that tug-of-war
and it's gonna pull that top layer down
so in reality
a cup of water actually looks like this
see that top layer these things get
pulled down and it sort of creates a
film right where the there's more
density of water molecules so it can
support more on the top surface right
forms like a skin so let's see that in
action I've got a penny right here and
I've got a question for you how many
drops of water you think I could put on
a penny make a guess in the comments or
tell someone you're with right maybe you
think it's like four or five or six
let's count these out together all right
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten oops 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
whoops
20 oh no I kind of it's really hard all
right a lot of this is coming out cuz I
suck at putting these drops out but if
you do this alone what you should find
is the number what happens is it bubbles
up like that on top right we did this in
rehearsal because we couldn't get in
tight enough but the numbers should be
somewhere around 40 so that's what we
saw when we were just doing it right
before this when I was a little bit
better with putting my drops out it
creates this it bubbles up like that
right and that makes sense because it's
like a skin where you see it kind of
pulling together on the outer surface
now animals in nature sort of know about
this and they take advantage of it can
you think of an animal that takes
advantage of this surface tension
phenomenon you got this water Strider
right and these are very fascinating
creatures maybe you've seen them this
should look kind of familiar unlike a
pond right see those little dimples
they're floating what's cool look how
they propel they've got two little oars
with their middle legs and the other
ones just keep them on top of the water
now these guys are kind of brutal I
didn't realize it they'll they'll find
animals that can't swim in the water
coming down the stream
and then they just like suck their guts
out which is uh yeah it's that's that's
nature for you this is amazing but
that's the circle of life the animals go
in there that's what they do they find
animals I can't swim and they just have
a nice juicy lunch so here's a question
for you
let's say you were in space and you had
a towel that was really wet right and he
went to wring it out now on earth if you
did that the water comes down what do
you think would happen in space make a
guess
tell Simone what do you think would
happen well we know what happens thanks
to the Canadian national treasure
commander Chris Hatfield he did this he
did this experiment check this out so
that's filled with water he's gonna
squeeze it but of course the water has
that skin on the outside that keeps it
together right that cohesion it's coming
up to divine the water is all over my
hands in fact it rings out of the cloth
into my hands and if I let go of the
cloth carefully
the water sort of has it sticked to my
hand you can see it it even sticks to
his hand there a little bit because
again it's like the water is like kind
of like magnets right
it's that surface tension that cohesive
forces want to stick together okay
so what if I told you there is a way to
totally destroy this cohesion and what
if I told you you've touched it today
hopefully I'm just gonna get right to
clue number two baby
so it's magical it does two things one
of the things it does is it destroys the
cohesion on the top surface so I'm gonna
come back here you might have seen this
before
something like this this is just a bull
with some pepper on top I'm gonna get a
little bit more and now I'm going to
take I'm just gonna dip this toothpick
in this soap right let's see what
happens it hits it and it goes all out
right it spreads out I have this pepper
in earlier so it didn't it doesn't go
out with like the amazing force you
should see if it's like fresh pepper in
there but you see how quickly it went
out right so let's talk about the mental
model there that can help us understand
that a little better
these molecules are all like kind of
holding hands to the top surface right
soap comes in and be like ah you guys
can't hold hands
break it up right so any any type of
cohesion where these molecules are kind
of attached to each other soap gets in
and it negates that and makes them like
non-magnetic anymore and so think of it
as like a net on the top surface
I've heard people explain this as like
oh the the particles run away from the
soap but if you have the mental model
that it's sort of like a net on this top
surface again if you have just a fresh
bowl of water this is really pronounced
I'm gonna do it again and think of like
a tight net on the top surface and it's
being cut just sliced right down the
middle and then what you see here should
really
make sense with that right so because
they're still forces out here you've cut
this net in the middle like a bungee
cord or rubberband and it kind of all
moves to the outside as you can sort of
see there so knowing that take a guess
at what happens here what do you think
would happen if I take another soaked
toothpick and I put it at the top of
this bowl with the paper clips well I
would guess those paper clips are gonna
move away and sink so this is a good
practical joke challenge someone you
have a bowl and they have a bowl and
then in your bowl give them soapy water
and you just have normal water and then
see like whose does better so now we're
gonna do another cool thing with the
same principle
I've got like a little foam boat here
okay I got this idea for my buddy
science Bob and I've just cut the back
out and what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take
this soap again this is something you
can do this is just like foam and I'm
gonna put it in this little I'm applying
the soap to this cavity see if you can
see it on this camera okay that little
triangular cutout is the only surface
that I'm sort of putting that soap on
okay now what do you think is gonna
happen if I put it in this trough right
I got a little rain gutter regatta here
okay let's see what happens when I stick
this boat in this water one two three
how cool is that we could have gone way
further what's great what's happening
here is you have that same principle
right because the triangle is happening
you have this triangle and that's where
it's breaking down the water
it's basically shooting out like rubber
bands out its back as it cruises along
we could've done like twice you can
totally do this yourself at home and now
here's a question if I have one that
looks like this all right you see how
the cutouts at an angle
what do you think would happen in that
case is the boat gonna go straight it's
shooting right and I tested this it does
it it's really cool if you have a bowl
you just have this thing going circles
because there's a thrust vector kind of
pointing out that way
so it spins around like this and it's
really cool so soak those two things
it's a one-two punch the first is this
like hey you to break it up those
cohesion forces it breaks it up that's
helpful when you're washing your hands
because instead of the water sticking
together it actually gets on your hands
and it can get into the dirt and it
breaks down the dirt a lot better
the second thing soap does though is
that it breaks down fat and this is why
soap is the freakin best when it comes
to coronavirus this is a coronavirus
it's just a shell that's kind of like a
fatty shell it's made of fat inside you
just got some DNA that's basically what
a virus is okay so the soap not only
will break up water pulp molecules and
make you get your hand better but it'll
come and just dissolve this shell this
this fat shell and then it just totally
makes the virus like not even a thing oh
all right
I'm gonna do something I shouldn't do I
need this rain gutter off it's filled
with water the EDS are kind of duct tape
so I'm just gonna cut the end and get it
out of the way for the next demo let's
see if this works
Wow it's working a lot better than I
anticipated it would alright
that's probably good you like come help
me grab this this is my amazing assisted
EUI just take that I'm gonna walk over
with you okay good good okay get out
here
thanks buddy alright now I've got this
dish here we're gonna demonstrate the
fact that it can destroy fat I've got
some whole milk you need you need to get
whole milk you can't do this with like
nonfat milk alright so you've already
showed what can do two cohesive forces
now because vitamin D has a lot of fat
I'm gonna pour this in here take some
cool food coloring and do this and make
a cool design okay let me see this okay
all right now I'm gonna dip two
toothpicks in our soap here what do you
think is gonna happen should see some
cool fireworks here let's see how cool
is that it feels like a super power or
it's just like shoots like a plasma so
again right there it's sort of
destroying that fat and getting rid of
any sort of the lipids that are actually
I can just hold this right here okay so
we're powering through this all right
now that brings us the clue number three
another fancy word which is adhesion
right we've got cohesion and adhesion
and in this case let's pull this camera
announced this is sort of cohesion is
when molecules stick together themselves
adhesion is when those same molecules
stick to the cup here
I threw it away right so you've got
these molecules cohesion is sticking
together adhesion is where they stick to
the thing on the outside
so with adhesion you get something like
this you see this red paper towel check
this out
you've probably seen this kind of
concept before see how it creeps up that
towel that's adhesion happening that's
just water there it's creeping up the
paper towel that's also called like
capillary action and the reason this
matters in nature a lot it's really
important a clue is on my shirt where as
capillary action happen in nature you
think big trees right it rains there's
water on the ground how do they get that
tree up they don't have pumps they get
it up through tiny little tubes veins
and it's this capillary action the
adhesions sticking to the side that
allows the water to go up the tree so
that's also like the no slip condition
if you take a fluid dynamics at the edge
you have the boundary layer the no slip
condition that's due to adhesion so what
if I told you there was also a way to
destroy adhesion right you've probably
seen this before I've got these two
shoes here okay see if you can guess
oops how's that again switch cameras all
right so here we go so that's see how
that's on the shoe see how it's starting
to like seep into the shoe itself it
runs off but it's kind of staining check
out this side how I just this is just so
cool look at that so what's happening is
these shoes have a special hydrophobic
coating on them that's kind of oily and
it's just not allowing those water
droplets to stick to it that would be
adhesion right so it destroys that
adhesion no matter what I try and do I
can't get it wet unlike this side right
that's just beautiful
so with something like this when you
make a hydrophobic coating on it you
solve the cohesion with that water and
scene itself but the adhesion basically
goes to zero that's because it has like
microscopically it's really rough and it
kind of makes the surface oily because
water and oil don't like to mix alright
so that kind of brings us to how to make
our hand waterproof okay so I've got
this water here and I've got some baby
powder basically and truth be told I
thought I thought this is still pretty
cool
I wanted something you guys could do at
home so if you just have some baby
powder it has to be the kind of talc I
can now stick my hand in here
see how it's staying dry you can go
pretty deep with it it's not like
perfectly perfectly waterproof but I
like that it's just something if you
tried using flour the water would soak
up and adhere to the flower but talc has
special properties that doesn't allow to
do that now my buddy science Bob he he
did this he had a special powder here we
go this powder is called Lycopodium
powder which is hydrophobic same
principle as the talc but you could go
even deeper into the water that's really
cool right so I have to of course give
the crown to my buddy Derek from
veritasium he used aerogel which just
with coronavirus you can to layer this
is awesome
[Music]
that is true all right so that's a bunch
of stuff that you could totally try at
home to just play around with this
concept of surface tension cohesion
adhesion a lot of stuff there hopefully
that makes sense knowledge Wireless
knowledge transfer complete so the
challenge for this time again not for
Wednesday but for Friday I want to see
who can put the most amount of paper
clips on a surface and then have some
creative way of destroying the cohesion
so by getting rid of the serpent ation
with some soap and then I want to see
them all fall down so who could do the
most and have a cool way to kind of have
the cohesion go away all right that's
the challenge speaking of a challenge
and and to submit that by the way just
tag me on social media could be Twitter
Instagram Facebook or tick tock here
there was the the the submissions from
last week or just freaking amazing
watch this
[Music]
what Cooper there at the end is cheating
I mean he used watermelons
he's Mario that pot is plaintive like a
tube he just he knew exactly what it's
gonna work for me so like I said last
time Bo's wanted to give out like eight
pairs of headphones so he's a 700 kind
of dope there they will be reaching out
to you and the next like day or so if
you were the ones one of the ones they
selected again I kind of struggle with
this like intrinsic versus extrinsic
rewards I don't I kind of want people to
do this for the sake of doing it to
learn the science and and to learn
something cool but it's cool sometimes I
think to offer something nice to if you
can so try and do it for the right
reasons if you wouldn't headphones so be
it but there's so much cool science here
to learn so once again for this Friday
we'll be giving out eight you can either
do the challenge or explain some topic
or you could just post about this class
to your friends on social media and
they'll pick someone and all those
things work and we kind of track it and
we'll reward those accordingly all right
so my friend diana is going to give
introduce the question for next week but
first I want to show this clip I found
on social media which is just so cool
this is a nurse who's going to work and
her neighbors came out to surprise her
[Applause]
[Laughter]
[Applause]
so got throw the music on and I'll just
say the next two weeks are probably
gonna be like kind of the little weird
there's gonna be a lot of people who are
you need to go to the hospital
social distancing hasn't fully kicked in
yet so just be sure that you're super
nice to the medical professionals like
that these nurses are literally risking
their lives for the rest of us as well
as like the delivery drivers right or
the people working in the grocery store
this is a time just to up our game and
to all come together and just be really
cool to each other like what can you do
personally if even if you're not in that
a professional or delivery driver just
work at the grocery store or something
you know what can you do to punch
coronavirus in the face and make
someone's day a little bit better this
is like tricky for all of us so we've
got to do our parts but having said that
you know I have full confidence we're
going to be fine this is gonna be bumpy
but together we got this so let me show
you this clip from Dianna introducing
next week's question hey Mark it's Diana
from the YouTube channel physics girl I
have a question for you so dire that I
had to send you a video message okay how
do astronauts weigh themselves when
they're weightless when they're floating
in space mm-hmm all right so how the
heck do astronauts weigh themselves in
space hi this is gonna be a really cool
lesson on inertia and mass there's a lot
of really interesting demos and really
cool mental models to be updated here so
don't just google the answer just try
and think of it I want creative answers
that aren't like the typical maybe even
that's not even how they actually do it
that just shows you've been thinking
about how they could possibly do
something like this so with that class
is officially dismissed I will go
through if I've got some questions and
you know you could leave now but I'll
answer like two or three minutes of
questions and then you know like I said
answer the questions the video
description do the challenge tag me on
anything on social media and we'll give
some people some headphones all right so
questions Papa Papa Papa is that your
hand at the beginning yes I do my own
stunts
good question Shirley
[Music]
what is your favorite video you've done
I did one on the rover landing that's
like one of my least popular videos
because it was like from 2012 or
something but when the rover we send the
Curiosity rover out again next February
I'm gonna rehash that one I think
because it's just it was really cool I
showed from like a personal standpoint
what it felt like to see the rover go to
Mars if you Sam if you become a teacher
would you be the kind of teacher that
would blow stuff up in your class if
your class is well behaved and if so
would it be a watermelon yes and yes
great question Sam is that hot as that
pointer a Hot Wheels track thank ya that
pointers a Hot Wheels track come on
only the best here all right isn't skin
hydrophobic kind of but not really like
it if you dip it in right it comes up
wet if it's truly hydrophobic it gets
rid of the adhesion and you wouldn't see
that wet part on your skin it's sort of
more or less impervious to water like if
you put it in your your fingers nails
your fingers do get kind of wrinkly on
the fingertips and stuff so not really
hydrophobic wate water is magnetic heck
yeah water is magnetic how cool is that
I think you can actually even do this if
you put a magnet under water and have it
running in your sink you put a magnet up
next to it you'll get the water stream
to actually bend towards the magnet
because it actually is magnetic all
right so is there film on the bottle or
that's pretty good we'll leave it at
that
so that's it for this week we'll see you
or for today we'll see you on Friday
because again no class Wednesday thanks
so much you guys are the best this is
crazy
we'll see you next time
welcome back besides class
I'm your host Mark Rover this is live
and it's good to be here today will be
answer the question how do astronauts
weigh themselves in space in space is
implied there because if you know if
you're rigging in zero-gravity your
waitlist a scale will just float right
by you right so what happens if you step
on it it's gonna read zero so how do
they know if they're gaining weight from
all that astronaut ice cream we're gonna
figure it out we'll give ourselves three
clues as usual we're gonna use as few
equations as possible
so you're gonna want to stick around to
the end because I'm going to talk about
I said I would do these for two weeks
and then we'd see how it's going I'm
gonna tell you what we're gonna be doing
moving forward and kind of how it's
going well let's just get right into it
here we go clue number one
objects are lazy Newton's first law
states objects are lazy all right this
hammer is just chillin here and it's not
moving it's not gonna move until unless
something comes and pushes it and makes
it move and if it is moving it's just
gonna keep moving until some other force
comes and stops it all right so it's
kind of like you're on your couch and
your mom's like hey you need to let the
dog out and you're like but I'm already
on the couch
I'm not moving I don't want to move
right or maybe you're walking out the
door now you're moving and your mom says
hey could you come back here real quick
you need to let the dog out and you're
like ah but I'm already moving right I
don't want to turn around so we have on
this table right here some objects that
are currently not moving we also have a
tablecloth underneath these objects so
what do you think would happen if I were
to pull this out really quickly well
these objects if Newton if Newton knew
what the heck he's talking about are
gonna want to stay still okay here we go
one two and don't try this at home by
the way this is for trained physics
professionals only all right
count me down one two actually do try it
at home but you should like check with
your parents first you should practice
with things that aren't your wife's
really nice glasses in place that she
doesn't know you have alright here we go
I only rehearse this once this may not
work here we go physics one two three
yeah I could count that as a win all
right here we go we're live we're
switching out the set the objects you'll
notice did not move okay back in here
now we've got another example I've got
this ball in this wagon the ball is not
moving what happens if I move the wagon
this way
well objects are lazy is it going to
come with it and just stay right there
is it going to move backwards or we'll
stay right where it's at let's test it
out one two three whoa probably move
forward just a little bit because of
friction but for the most part it stays
right where it's at okay so that's two
examples of this concept of Newton's
first law where the things were
stationary and they just wanted to
continue to be stationary now let's do
two examples where they're moving I'm
gonna put this ball at the back of the
cart now I'm gonna move it and then stop
the cart should have an intuition on
what's gonna happen right the ball keeps
moving it's like yo I'm moving I just
want to keep moving that's what I'm
doing all right
here is another example that you know
this stuff already you're just as smart
Newton as Newton you got this ketchup
bottle if you need to get the ketchup
out what do you do well you do this why
do you do this because you're like hey
ketchup in bottle move together the same
speed but I'm gonna I'm gonna arrest the
motion of the bottle over a very short
period of time that ketchup is going to
keep moving and move to the bottom right
that's Newton's first law so
this is why if you're in a car and
you're going 50 mile the cars going 50
miles an hour so are you if you hit a
brick wall there's a moment in time
where the car is stopped and you're
still going 50 miles an hour this is why
seatbelt and airbags are important when
we send stuff to Mars we put it in this
spaceship we get it out of our
atmosphere
we don't actually fire a rocket the
whole way there for nine months you just
fire it right at the beginning you fire
it and then you glide to Mars at 25,000
miles per hour five times faster than a
bullet that's like a hundred and fifty
football fields a second right you glide
real fast because once you're moving
Newton's first law once you're moving
you're gonna keep moving until some four
stops you from moving
we even have little motors on there we
call them like mouse fart motors you
just need a little poof nothing much
just a little poof if you need a course
correct right cuz over such a long
distance even if you move an inch over
you know a thousand miles that adds up
and could mean the difference between
missing Mars and actually landing okay
here we go
clue number two we're getting close to
answering this question good throw
inertia all right
what is inertia mean inertia is a body's
ability to resist motion right so think
of like a huge semi truck versus this
wagon which resists motion easier which
is easier to push to get going
obviously the wagon right which once
it's moving if a big trucks coming out
and you have to stop it which is easier
to stop well obviously this wagon you
can have this hammer yeah versus this
big weight right if one of these is
coming at your head which one did you
rather be well this light hammer because
you could just deflect it out of the way
right this big weight resists being
moved better so it has more inertia so
did you know that ships big ships cruise
ships cargo ships when they're coming
into port they turn off their motors
they're like 25 kilometers or 15 miles
out from the port because they just have
that much inertia to slowly come to
speed and to come into port so heavier
things have more inertia and guess what
you knew this too you are basically
Isaac Newton if I handed you this piece
of duct tape and this spool of copper
wire I said put out your hands okay do
this with me put out your hands
imagine you've got these things and I
said which one weighs more what do you
do I guarantee you what you do
intuitively is you move them up and down
right you go okay okay okay all right
you don't just sit them still right the
heavier one will resist changes more and
so you're determining which is heavier
by trying to change its motion in time
the one that resists that more to your
muscles is the heavier one so if you
were gonna crash into me if I was gonna
play football I'm a soccer player I just
don't have the body for a football
player but if I did play football I
would take one of these 25 pound weights
sneak it under my pads why that would
give me more inertia more ability to
resist changes in motion so if you ran
up and crashed into me aside from the
fact that this would be hard I feel it
less right if a football player hits a
brick wall at pre-qual and going
anywhere so the more mass you have the
more yours is that motion now keep that
in mind we're gonna do something here
let's switch cameras I've got a bunch of
nails here now lest you say these are
like plastic fake nails this is just an
apple little Isaac Newton action boom we
just impaled this Apple all right so I'm
gonna do something crazy want you to see
if you could spot the cheat I'm gonna do
something that seems more crazy but in
reality it's actually making it easier
on me okay I'm gonna lay down here I'm
gonna get some help or my trusty
assistants okay
Thank You Eli these nails are now
on my chest and we're gonna put a big
fat heavy cinderblock on there and now
my friend Alex when I count to three is
gonna shatter that cinder block okay
this is live anything can happen
you ready Alex if this hurts your fire
here we go one two three yeah
okay now let's go to the wide camera and
tell me if you were able to catch the
cheat all right what did I put on that
right at the end I put this big heavy
block right why did I do that well the
truth is it would have hurt a lot more
if Alex would have hit me with that
sledgehammer without this brick why well
this brick has mass it's heavy it has a
lot of inertia right so when that
sledgehammer hit it I didn't even feel
that sledgehammer hit for a little bit
because this brick was so heavy the
sledgehammer is trying to move this that
it's like uh-uh I ain't moving right so
while it might have seemed more extreme
it actually saved me from like feeling
more force right so here's a question is
this cinderblock really is heavy in
space would it be heavy
well stuff floats in space right there's
no gravity so what's up with that that
leads us to our last clue clue number
three the concept of mass versus weight
all right so mass is just a measure of
how much stuff is in a thing all right
how many atoms are in there basically so
weight is how the object interacts with
Earth's gravitational field right so
basically on Mars gravity is one-third
what it is here on earth you could dunk
a basketball on Mars on the moon it's
1/6 so
you could basically hold this pretty
easy on Mars on the moon you could
really hold it easy but there's one
thing that wouldn't change right if I
were to hand this to you on Mars or the
moon or even on the International Space
Station I said how much it weighs guess
what you would do you do the same thing
you here on earth and you move it back
and forth that doesn't change whether
you're in space or weather here on earth
yeah it's gonna be heavier due to
gravity but the mass the ability to
resist that motion is the same all right
so you thinking ahead so you can't use a
scale on the space station to get your
weight but there is a way to see how
much mass something has or by conversely
if you want to convert it multiplied by
its gravity and know the weight and
here's a clue maybe you're getting close
to figuring out our answer all right
I've got this paint bucket and a spring
here and you'll see look how frequently
it goes up and down right okay now I'm
gonna change it with something it
doesn't weigh quite as much I want you
to compare the frequency how frequently
it goes up and down so this goes up and
down more frequently it has a higher
frequency we call that the natural
frequency it's proportional square root
of K over m fancy words K basically
means how stiff your spring is and M is
the mass is what you have hanging here
so the lighter the mass the higher this
natural frequency would be okay you're
getting it you're kind of honing in on
what the answer is let me show you
something right here so this is one of
those things at the playground
right without anyone on it this is how
quickly it goes back and forth and if I
were to walk up and of course
coronavirus proof it first of all safety
first and then I got on it this is how
it naturally wants to go back that's
lower-frequency that's happening less
frequently and so that gives us an
answer to we'll come back to the
computer this is actually on the space
station see if this looks familiar an
astronaut gets in some device check him
out so they know the stiffness of that
spring and so however many times he goes
back and forth that tozi his mast here's
another version that's more similar to
the one that I was going up and down
here with so the more frequently he goes
the less mass that person has the fewer
atoms the slower he goes back and forth
the more mass okay there's another way
you can do this using our good old F
equals MA which we talked about if you
were to push let's say this is on ice if
you were to push with a known force my
arms this would accelerate slower then
say this lighter hammer right if you
were to push same muscles my arms same
force this is gonna accelerate faster so
another way they do this is with this an
instrument like this depending they know
the force of that arm and depending on
how quickly they accelerate you can back
out you could solve for what the mass is
so that is how astronauts weigh
themselves they use inertia and they use
our good old buddy Newton and you knew a
lot of this stuff too so hopefully what
you didn't know though that wireless
transfer worked for my brain in two
years knowledge transfer complete you
can rewatch that if there are some parts
that you missed all right
this has been really fun for me I've
really enjoyed doing these live classes
I want to keep doing them I'm gonna
commit to doing them for another month
however I'm willing to do one a week
because it is sort of hard with all this
going on to do three week I'm doing this
all for the first time and I want to
keep making my normal videos and spend
time with my family like the coronavirus
is kind of an a bummer but it has
provided the opportunity just to hang
out and spend more quality time together
so I don't want to miss that
opportunity so we're doing Wednesdays
1:00 p.m. I'll do that at least for a
month and then once again we revisit
hopefully you guys are having fun with
this as much as I am so let's look at
some responses to the challenge video
then I'll give you the challenge for
this week this was amazing here we go
[Music]
this is a 100 paper clip machine all
right you guys are so stinking creative
I think I don't want to pigeonhole you
I've decided and give you a specific
challenge I want you to just blow my
mind teach some of these demonstrations
to someone explain to the camera what
inertia this do some of these demos come
up with your own demos just do something
do something cool and and send it to me
and I want to see it both gave eight of
those nice a 700 bed phones to people
who either shared about this class on
social media or send in some of those
demos so keep up the amazing work that's
been so fun for me to see what you guys
submit okay so that's the challenge for
this time we're gonna get to next
wednesday's question and a quick QA but
first I got to have our music moment
this is something I was thinking about
recently I get I've been getting a lot
of responses and seeing a lot of there's
a lot of girls watching this class and
women which i think is
fantastic I recently went to Dubai and
it was like all the top science kids in
the country and more than half of them
were women which surprised me because
you think like but at least some of the
you know they're no less progressive as
far as like women's rights and stuff and
I asked them what's up with that and
they're like look Dubai it's a small
country we need everyone's brains we
can't just say it's just the dudes like
we need everyone's brains and I thought
that was really powerful some of the
best engineers I've worked with at both
NASA and Apple were women and you might
have noticed my first three shoutouts
were some of my friends who are who are
into science and engineering who were
women the last one Diana she has a great
can of channel called physics girls she
just did a bunch of a video where she
did a bunch of experiments you could do
all around your house it's fascinating
you should go check it out I'll put a
link in the description but I want the
girls out there to have good role models
for what you could be the challenges we
face today in the world and that we will
face in the near future are too big to
cast aside 50% of the equal pay equally
capable brains because of antiquated
social norms so this is all hands on
deck if you're a girl and you like
science and engineering but you're like
it's only guys know that Mark Rover has
your back all right future generations
have your back they need you to
trailblaze and to make it more
normalized to see more women in science
and engineering fields in the stem and
steam fields all right so you guys need
to be the Trailblazers so that we can
tap into that brainpower which a lot of
times is better than us dudes anyways
all right
rant over here we go
here is the challenge for next time or
the question I should say for my buddy
Bob hey I'm Bob from I like to make
stuff I was sitting here working on my
r2d2 and a thought came to my mind and I
thought I should ask mark so mark what
would happen if all the toilets in the
world were flushed at the exact same
time okay an intriguing question indeed
next time we're gonna talk a little bit
about pressure we're gonna go a little
bit more into the bed and nail stuff and
even up the danger level so with that
class is technically officially
dismissed I will stick around and ask a
few minutes of questions and then I'll
see you guys next Wednesday all right
what was your job in position when you
worked at NASA I was a cognizant
engineer so I was in charge of like one
chunk of the Rober of the rover so that
was for like six years or seven years
and so yeah I worked with a team of
people and but at the end of the day was
my design in my hardware and I worked a
lot of smart people thermal analysts and
stress analysts and machinists and
everyone you have a massive team of
people who help you do something like
that but that's how they do it they
divide the Rover up into chunks and
everyone gets a small chunk mine was
very small by the way what was your best
April Fool's joke the the backup camera
one is like a classic where you take
like a Freddy Krueger picture put it
behind like your parents backup camera
or your wife's in my case they put in
Reverse they see this big thing that's a
classic just a classic my poor wife she
just has the patience of Joe being
married to me let's see okay here's the
question now would astronauts weigh less
or more when they fart it's complicated
certainly their mass is less and
technically mass is really what matters
force equals the force of gravity is
mass times so I I would say the answer
to your question the fair one is that
they actually do weigh less but that
gets into like a parent weight which I
didn't get into the other day there's
it's its technical but let's say less
alright one more question how can you
weigh something in space that's too big
alright let's take this let's say
there's an asteroid going around and
well there's a couple different ways one
you could look at like the gravitational
force two bodies coming together
there's a simple equation as the
attraction so you could look at how much
it's attracted when it goes by earth how
much does it move right that will tell
you how much it bends in Earth's
gravitational field will tell you how
much it weighs another way you could
technically like if you have a rocket
thrusters with a known force you kind of
push on them right in the same way force
equals mass times acceleration you
couldn't do a Big Spring but if you had
rocket thrusters and you pushed on that
ever so slightly you would see
especially in space where there's no air
resistance exactly how much you changed
its motion due to its inertia and from
that you could easily calculate what the
mass is all right you guys are the best
this is really fun I'm gonna see you
next Wednesday we got some cool stuff
we'll find out what happens if
everywhere in the world flushes their
toilets all at once
this is hardcore science we're answering
the important questions see on Wednesday
[Music]
welcome to science class I'm mark Rover
this is where we answer important
questions like what if all the toilets
in the world flushed at once we have
three clues we try and use as few
equations as possible to answer it this
is alive so anything could go wrong and
that just may happen to do it cuz
there's a lot of moving parts and I wish
we could rehearse this more so a couple
really fun announcements we have Kahoot
this time so check the link in the video
description if you want to join the
Kahoot I'm gonna ask three questions
throughout this and you could try and
make a guess and see if you can get it
right as usual I'll have a Q&A at the
end
real quick announcement as you know
coronavirus I'm making these videos I'm
also still trying to fill in normal
YouTube videos I may not be able to do
this class next Wednesday I said we
doing weekly but at this point just
consider these babies a bonus and I will
leave a link in the announcement in the
the top to pin comment on this video
also in the video description letting
you know whether or not we'll have class
this Wednesday or next Wednesday what
you should know though is this has been
a lovely experience for me and even if
these live classes don't continue
forever
some reincarnation of this will be in
the future I've really enjoyed getting
more into the physics and the details of
this fun stuff so don't worry if you've
loved this and these don't go forever as
I switch back to my monthly videos so
with that let's just get right the heck
into it
clue number one pressure vs. force what
do those things mean so I've got a book
here a really good physics book and I've
got a scale here if I put this book on
this scale no matter which way I orient
it what will the scale read they'll be
the same force right if you're standing
on a scale in your bathroom whether you
have two feet on or one feet on it still
reads the same now what about the
pressure though you're like well I'm not
really sure what the pressure is right
if I put it on this edge or this corner
vs. flat like this you can think
pressure is like which pokes you more
which feels sharper and so if you had
your hand here and you did the corner of
the book versus the flat part which part
pokes you more right
probably the corners right let's do
another example if I'm walking in my
house and I hit a table if I hit the
edge here versus if I bump into the
corner which hurts more
which pokes you mark now remember same
force right it's just me walking into it
but one of them will hurt more and poke
you more right so we're kind of honing
in on this concept of pressure let's say
your friend comes up to you and says hey
Mark
I want to push on you with one pound and
I'm like one pound that's not that big
of a deal but then I turn around and
your friend pulls out this is just a
little screwdriver which is a little
point on the top it's basically a
pinpoint and she's and then and then
she's like okay here's my one pound
right instead of using your hand she
uses this this sharp pin that's gonna
hurt okay
remember it's same force the pressure is
different so we're kind of honing in on
this concept of pressure so there's
actually a formula for this we use
limited formulas but pressure equals
force over area force over area okay
area means like you know if there's a
pizza a bigger Pizza has more area it's
like the inches squared right so this
makes sense force per area pounds per
square inch maybe you've heard of a
pressure in psi pounds per square inch
right so here's the question let's say
you just got new floors in your house
and there's two organisms out front
there's a woman with these high heels on
and she weighs 10 110 pounds or maybe
it's joe exotic these are nice and tiger
right there out front of your house and
there's an elephant you got these lovely
new floors and you're like I don't want
them to get ruined which would you let
into your house the elephant or the
person wearing these heels that weighs
110 pounds so if you said the elephant
you were wrong by a factor of 10 because
there's such a small area on these
actually do the math an elephant's foot
is like this big around right the
elephant weighs 5 tons the woman only
weighs 110 pounds but the pressure from
these heels is ten times more than the
elephant which means your floors would
get damaged ten times more likely with
these heels than a stinking elephant all
right so now maybe that'll help you
understand if you ever on ice and thin
ice and you're like holy crud this might
crack what's your best move your best
move is not to stand straight up
and have a small area because a smaller
in the denominator means the pressure is
gonna be more you want to like lay out
flat or at least go on all fours because
then you're dividing the pressure up
between the area that's touching the ice
so here's a little demo that'll help us
understand this I've got a board here
okay here we go I've got a balloon all
right if I put this balloon on these two
nails you can see there's two nails
right here okay I'm gonna set this
balloon on here put this board down and
I'll just set some tape on top whoa big
whoop right you're like wow mark that's
fascinating the balloon popped because
of two nails what do you think is gonna
happen if I take this balloon though and
now I've got 12 nails okay
that's twelve nails that could be like
twelve times as many holes it's gonna be
way more pokey right I'm gonna do the
same thing put that little lid down I'm
gonna put the tape on now I'm gonna put
the ball on it's still not popping now
I'm gonna put this box on now I'm gonna
put this Apple on crazy right and now
lest you're like Oh mark will you just
using a a really thick balloon no tricks
here baby
we're gonna spin back around and you'll
see when it's on two nails it pops again
so by the way I just want to
teas at the end of this last week I did
the bed of nails but I just had it on my
chest we're leveling up today baby I've
got a board of nails right down here now
I'm gonna lay on 6-inch nails then I'm
gonna have the one on my chest and then
the cinder block and we're gonna see if
I could survive just for me to prove
that I believe in physics and I believe
in pressure now why would the bed of
nails work why does this make it hurt
less well you ever lifted something
heavy and the more people you get around
the table or the couch it's less force
each person has to do less right so
there's 12 nails here if I put 12 pounds
worth of stuff on top each nail now only
has to support a pound of piece they
divide it up just like lifting a couch
right and so if there's less force per
nail each nail has less pressure so
that's the physics I will demonstrate my
belief in when we do the bent nails at
the end hopefully there's enough nails
that the pressure individually in any
spot on my back will be low enough all
right here we go
baby this is a super cool one of those
mental model things that I love okay
I've got this Apple here I'm gonna try
and cut it with the ruler now you're
probably thinking at home mark you are
just freaking crazy there's no way
that's gonna work and the truth is that
is not working okay
turns out you can't cut an apple with a
ruler I have a knife okay same force
it's my arm same motion Wow
can't you see that's cuts what is going
on there that's something obvious that
you see all the time but what's the
difference the pressure is higher why
it's the area when we say something is
sharp what we're really meaning is this
there's just less area right here write
the number on the bottom is smaller so
when I'm sharpening a knife what you're
really doing is just trying to reduce
the area for which you will apply to the
thing you're trying to cut remember same
force smaller the area you push just
like the pin on your back
the more pressure there's going to be
and that brings us to our clue number
two and I've kind of been alluding to
this yeah but it's pressure or what
we'll talk about stress in a minute that
breaks stuff it's not force okay if you
were to zoom in on this Apple real close
you have these Apple molecules that are
all holding hands like the game Red
Rover right and with this ruler what
you're doing because there's like a wide
force you're sending all those people
trying to rush into the Red Rover arms
over the maybe it's like if you zoom in
again maybe it's 12 people and they're
like oh we can handle that right each
arm they're holding hands we got this
but when you switch to a knife it's like
hey guys huddle up now when we charge
these guys let's all go for one person
mark and this guy next home everyone go
for that that arm instead of spreading
out and when you do that my individual
hand strength next to the person it's
too much locally it's like a laser beam
it's too much and we have to let go and
so that's what happens these Apple
molecules break because the energy at
that one hand hold exceeds their ability
to hold hands
there's something called finite element
analysis I use this a lot at NASA I use
this a lot when I worked for Apple so
what happens is you break them a fan in
this case up you look at each individual
individual and element and you look at
the stress because stress is basically a
pressure as felt by an object or a
material and it's like wherever it's red
it's like yo Red Rover hands that's too
high I'm gonna break that's gonna rip
off same for like a bridge right you do
this analysis and it's like look this
red spot is too high
Red Rover hands we're gonna break there
and it could be catastrophic so you
either have to change the design or just
beef up with some material right in that
spot so okay here we go we're gonna
change gears just a little bit a new
breakfast so I'm gonna have a little bit
of Apple now let's talk about liquid
pressure okay we talked about this in
the pool eating that Apple as a mistake
we talked about this in a pool when you
Poole your ears hurt right because
there's so much stuff above you it's
like being in the bottom of a dog pile
there's lots of water molecules the
deeper you go the more your ears hurt
the more pressure you feel right so
here's our first Kahoot question I've
got this 3 litre bottle there's three or
two liter bottle there's three holes in
it I want to know which hole is gonna
shoot the water the furthest this bottom
hole the middle one or the top I'm gonna
shoot it off the edge and of his bucket
below okay let me get it set up here
this is live whoa
easy girl okay take off the top so did
we put the question in okay so it'll be
ten seconds okay so now we're asking the
question okay so go ahead and let's see
not this one okay I put it out of order
I missed my buddy Josh here out actually
this is a better one to start with okay
you want to keep that one up we're live
we're live okay back to me can we go
back to that Josh or do we already lose
it okay I'm s Josh yep basically we had
some vases that had different shapes the
point was the okay yeah right there the
question was on which of these is the
pressure the greatest a B C D and E now
remember my excel stories remember that
all that matters is the depth right so
the correct answer is even though these
have different shapes it's all the same
pressure at that same death okay so now
let's come back to here let's do the
next question which is what I'd
previously setup we're live baby
so which hole is going to shoot the
bottom the furthest the top one the
middle one or the bottom okay we're
getting the answers in okay at home even
if you're not on the Kahoot if you're
watching this delayed go ahead and
answer what you think the answer would
be well I get this right
okay do we get answers
alright so most people said is that in
the top the middle most people said the
bottom which was the red one right okay
most people set the middle all right
here we go let's see four right here we
go now remember where's the pressure the
highest the deeper you go and if you
have a squirt gun do you want it to have
high pressure or low pressure well high
pressure means you're shooting farther
right so technically I would think it's
going to be the bottom one because that
should be the highest pressure right
it's the squirt gun with the most
pressure here we go let's see and look
at that I don't know if you could see
there I'll try and line it up but the
answer is in fact the bottom one is
shooting the farthest hopefully you can
see that on one of the cameras okay here
we go and you really are seeing it now
you see that bottom one the top one
doesn't even have any air because that
is where you have the highest pressure
get in there okay all right so let's see
let's do another example of this where
let's bring this bucket up Alex so the
way to think about this the reason if
you go back to the vases where it's like
all that matters doesn't matter the
shape of the pool you're in right all
that matters is what's directly above
your head so think of you're in a pool
the pressure you feel it's kind of like
stacks of plates on your head and
whether or not there's a lot of people
next to you with stacks of plates on
their head the only thing that matters
is what's directly above you so another
way to phrase that is I've got this big
tub here that's really deep this is a
big swimming pool and another one here
they are the same height we have a coupe
for this one oh yeah so they are the
same height in water which will shoot
further which pressure will be greater
okay
well based on what I would just said
miss that a little bit they should shoot
the same right
and sure enough we can see in case it
doesn't tilt back camera now in just
slightly Josh and back up they are
shooting the same this one drained
faster so it went a little bit more but
right at the beginning now that this
load level is lower it's not shooting as
far they're shooting the same distance
all right Alex let's come take this away
here we go okay so what the heck does
all this mean well there's a very common
case where you see people taking
advantage of this concept of fluid
pressure and using it very cleverly
around like just basically in and around
anywhere you go here's an example of one
right here what you'll notice here see
these little Pistons those are filled
with oil those are filled with fluid and
maybe you've noticed before these little
hoses that's pumping oil in and out of
this piston let me show you how that
works here so let's come back here let's
go to the tight camera basically I've
got these hydraulic these are those
little syringes here right well as I
push these in and out this thing moves
up and down right you can see I have
three degrees of freedom and I have
three ways to toggle it these are just
little syringes filled with water liquid
and so this is taking an advantage of
the fact that water is incompressible
and I could have a pump way down here at
the base of the excavator and up here I
could use some mechanical advantage and
I could get it to do a lot of work you
see hydraulics like this in a lot of
cases so this actually demonstrates
Pascal's principle and I should say by
the way this is from Kiwi Co I asked
them to borrow this and they said hey
Mark
while we just sponsored this livestream
so I said okay cool I'm a huge fan of
what they do and you should know by the
way if someone's getting money to say
something being sponsored you should
always take with a grain of salt you
should also know that I say no to like
95% of the people who want a sponsor
with me on my channel unless I truly
believe in their product and that's the
case here they have monthly crates from
ages 2 up to 16 years old I went there
the other day you can see this this is
me with my buddy Destin so we're playing
air hockey with a little inverted
balloon which I'll explain here hockey
table would be super expensive so you
could turn it on its head instead of
having the tea will have all the air you
do it in the puck check that how cool is
that
and people have told me like mark you
should do a crate well it's like I I
don't know what to do to improve on what
they do I seriously love what they do
and what they stand for and how they do
it and so I know their president Sandra
she's super cool it's just a great
company and I totally stand behind way
they do it especially right now
obviously everyone's stuck at home
they come to your house they have these
kits you get to put them together you
get to learn science they have little
booklets that teach you cool things
about what you're putting together so
Cuba cocoa slash mark rover there's a
link in the video description and you
get your first month free and I honestly
think if you love my science classes and
what we do here you will absolutely love
what they do what they stand for your
kids I look forward to getting these
every month we get a couple boxes to our
house okay so with that in mind it's
time for our last clue water towers
you've seen what of waters you may have
seen this before this is a water tower
what's the purpose of a water tower
have you ever wondered that you see
these especially like in older cities
the goal for a water tower coming back
to me is basically to put those water
at a high height high potential energy
right we talked about the pool the lower
you go only thing that matters is height
doesn't matter however you get there the
lower you go the bigger difference who
the water between where the water is
stored and where the water comes out is
how much pressure you'll have okay so
and a lot of times the water treatment
plants are at a lower likely to kind of
by the ocean so it's like that Delta
that makes the big difference that gives
you water pressure basically in your
house so the question now what happens
then if all the toilets flush at once so
we've got one more Kahoot here and we'll
put it up so tell me what you think the
answer will be what happens if all the
toilets flush at once is it not much
like a little bad or nothing bad
let's see based on what we've talked
about so far okay it's basically split
right down the middle and the answer
actually is a lot bad happens because if
you think about what's happening these
toilets in the of themselves hold water
they're like little water towers
themselves when you flush the toilet all
this water comes that's gonna be a
higher potential energy than the water
treatment plant and it starts with like
four inch pipes from your house and it
gets to the street maybe it's like what
like a foot eventually you get like ten
foot pipes as you get closer to the
treatment facility
but even that we'd get oh it's so
overloaded with water the pressure would
be too high especially it points in the
pipe that are like lower and they're a
little bit weaker maybe a little rusted
it would absolutely burst through the
weak spots in the pipe on top of that
you know you have sort of these like
lift stations that sometimes if you have
to get over a mountain the water stacks
up there you lift it up get over the
mountain and then keep going down those
would absolutely get backed up and so
the water that was on its way up the
hill would then come back down and then
this is the real kicker all that raw
sewage would come back up the pipe into
the pipes up through your toilet up
through your sink up through your
washer it's bad news I have this clip
here of this dude in France who recently
tried this with Orbeez in his bathtub
you might have seen this he didn't do it
like me you're supposed to use salt dude
when you're done to make it shrink down
and so then because all the pipes in
your house are connected naturally
witness toilet written to his sink and
then he tries to flush the toilet with
predictable results I can't speak French
or German but I don't think what he's
saying you should repeat and and not
only that isn't in his house but he went
outside it's coming up through the storm
drains right and then the police come
and it doesn't end doesn't end very well
so alright that's the answer then bad
things happen we're gonna end with me on
a bed of nails as promised for me to
prove that I believe in this physics
stuff so once again this is what I'm
gonna lay on okay here's an apple show
I'm not making this stuff up why does
that happen well there's a lot of
pressure and like we said pressure is
what breaks stuff so it's breaking the
skin on that Apple this is the board I'm
gonna lay on this is the board that's
gonna go on top of me by the way this
really is dangerous I'm gonna lay on
this and it doesn't feel great so this
is one example of what you should not
try at home even on your adult
supervision I would not recommend this
all right I don't want to get sued okay
here we go
doing this for physics yah okay if I was
laying on one nail that'd be terrible
right but luckily all the nails are
spreading this out oh my hat okay
now we're gonna put this on my chest
here we go oh boy it's like a marker
over sandwich of nails now comes on
block oh I'm making poor life choices
okay I'm doing this one for physics Alex
don't not yet he's gonna crack this with
that hammer and remember the things that
helped me out fact that this brick here
actually kind of helps me it's inertia
right helps me from stealing some of the
blow the fact that this brick will
hopefully break that will take some of
the energy with that I'm ready to prove
my belief in physics Alex you ready
three two one okay go back to the wide
camera Alex oh I just approve let's do a
test here you take a drink of water
no waters leaking out no holes baby we
did it pressure that's what it's all
about that worked because there was a
bunch of nails to help sort of diffuse
that force right okay so I'm gonna give
you guys the challenge for this week
okay before we do that I'm just gonna
tell you about a link in the description
and now I'm gonna play the music
my buddy jacksepticeye did a stream
yesterday they raised 1.7 million
dollars for this whole Cove in 19 thing
if you've wanted to help donate money
but weren't sure where to do it
tilt if I set up this this this funding
thing the money goes to the United Way
the United Nations Foundation and Red
Nose Day splits up between those three
things so I made a donation if you've
wanted to help but weren't sure where
this is like a super vetted way to put
your money to really great use so that
link is in the video description shout
out the jack for being awesome okay
here's the time whenever we meet next
here's the question for my friend Dustin
let's see I'm going to skip that video
first hey Mark its Destin so we are out
here on the front line
well actually we're not the frontlines
we're trying to get these space shields
to the frontlines so that doctors and
nurses can use them as they work against
the virus here but I know you're doing a
livestream today and you're answering
science questions and so one question I
had is is it possible to survive a
landing without a parachute is there a
way to do that let me know okay so the
question is if you jump out of a
parachute and your parachute fails how
can you survive that there is the way
it's a small chance but there's a way
you could survive that all right that's
what we're gonna talk about next
fascinating topic now I'm gonna show you
some results from last week's challenge
the people who got a bunch of Bose
headphones and then I'm gonna show you
the challenge for this week or give you
the challenge for this week so here are
the some of the responses we got
[Music]
there's been so fun to see these
responses so once again I think I just
want to keep it open-ended and just blow
my mind come up with something cool
teach me about some principle teach your
friends about kind of you know pressure
versus force Pascal's law what it means
to have something sharp anything along
these lines talking with pressure
different depths and then the winner
this time six people will get a
three-month three free months of boxes
from Kiwi Co because they're awesome so
blow my mind we'll pick the people you
will get them we're gonna do a QA now so
class is technically officially
dismissed will do the QA and then don't
forget we may not do it next week I'll
put the link in the pinned comment and
the top in the video description to kind
of let you know but otherwise be friggin
awesome so classes dismissed under like
three minutes worth of questions thank
you there's my phone and and then you
get the heck out of here okay here we go
did that hurt yes a little bit
once again I mean it didn't hurt that
bad obviously if I did one nail I like
would have a punctured lung and I would
be here at this moment so it didn't hurt
so bad but let's see do you have any
tinkerer crates yes I honestly get these
we get a couple every month and we
forget love doing them they're great
what is did you want to be a physics
teacher when you're little no I mean
once I took physics I thought well this
is cool and I just love talking about
this stuff with my friends so it made it
a lot more fun okay
[Music]
okay how do toilets work in space I'm
not perfectly qualified to answer that
but I if I recall they kind of have like
a vacuum tube
obviously you couldn't flush the water
no gravity so it's some form of like a
vacuum tube
why doesn't gravity crush us great
question that's a topic for a future
science class remember we are in a fluid
air is pushing around us all around just
like being in a pool and you feel that
pressure but we're gonna talk about
gravity and stuff in a future class okay
so that's it be good you guys are
awesome thanks for being here
we're live we'll see you next time blow
me away with cool demos bye
so if there's one thing we learned from
watching scooby-doo is that introducing
annoying character it's like scrappy-doo
to pander to a more juvenile demographic
will fatally alienate your core audience
hmm but if there's a second thing we
learn from watching scooby-doo is that
nobody everything's to check the picture
frames for the bad guys which is
precisely why I invented the Scoob cam
here's how it works so you go to
Goodwill and you get like a three dollar
picture frame with an awesome owl like
that and then you took out the owl and
you use a cardboard backing and then you
get a portrait like this and carefully
cut out the eyes and then tape it to the
front of the cardboard and you start a
FaceTime chat between two mobile devices
and then tape the smaller device to back
the picture frame where you cut out the
eyes if you want to be on all the time
mount the picture near an outlet you
built some rigor on the iPad I use some
duct tape and some paint sticks from
Lowe's then you take some glasses like
this take another portrait cut out where
the eyes used to be and put those on the
front of the glasses and attach them to
the rig and there you go so you could be
using this thousands of miles away from
the picture frame and you get a live
video and audio feed and you can even
talk back through the picture so you get
all the convenience of a scooby-doo bad
guy without having to do any
construction on your wall
honestly traditional security systems
worthless all the thief has to do is
guess your 16 digit passcode and he's in
now you can take control protecting your
Mountain Chateau and all you need the
Wi-Fi connection
and for a little extra intimidation
personally I'd go with mr. T
but that's not all use it to eavesdrop
on your sister Jeff he's totes fab or
corporate espionage offers 30 vote we
should go 25 maybe in 24 let's offer
them 22 or even just checking in on the
little ones it's convenient easy and
doesn't look creepy at all
so don't ask your security specialist if
the scoop cam is right for you because
you can trust me I'm wearing a lab coat
and like any good pharmaceutical
commercial I'm showing some happy images
that have nothing to do with the words
I'm speaking hey guys so obviously that
was pretty ridiculous
but if you don't actually need the
surveillance aspect here you can
recreate a simplified version of a
scooby-doo bad guy picture frame with
just a single mobile device but he is
download the free app I made this last
Halloween called digital dust and then
use the eyeballs for like the Obama guy
I also put some free links to all the
pictures I used in this video to cut the
eyeballs out of there all 11 by 17 and
they're posted in the description below
so that basically means for three
dollars invested a goodwill you are
gonna have some awesome wall decor next
time your friends come over oh and in
two weeks I'll be releasing my
technology infused ugly Christmas
sweater concepts so if you're still
looking for an idea
you best be subscribing either up there
or in the link below this video
you
this is a specialized human-shaped shark
cage i designed
and this is me in the middle of a shark
feeding frenzy
in that cage which is that happens
doesn't actually keep the sharks out
they're
in the freaking cage but to understand
how i ended up in the middle of the
bahamas with buckets of blood
surrounded by a butt ton of sharks we've
gotta go back
exactly one year because that's when i
ran a test to see what really happens if
sharks smell a drop of human blood
in the water for that experiment i
pumped out 15 drops of human blood per
minute for an
hour pretty close to a bunch of sharks
that in the end
just weren't really that interested so
this busted the myth from the movies
that sharks are these ruthless killers
that just go
crazy if they smell a drop of your blood
from a mile away
but those results made me really curious
if the sharks would react differently to
fish blood
versus human blood and if they did go
crazy for fish blood
could i use that to put myself right at
the center of a shark feeding frenzy
and so to satiate my curiosity my
friends at discovery helped me make my
way back to the bahamas as part of shark
week this year but this time
i wouldn't be alone what up robes oh wow
mark's jumping in on this
what's up y'all look last shark week
shark tried to kill me i think we'll
have a little bit of science with robert
a little bit of fun with dude perfect
and a little bit of me
all right you all ready to do this we
were born ready sir
all right chop chop let's get to it
fellas we will not let you down
looking forward to it see ya yeah i've
got this idea for
a bill to just really get me in close
with the sharks
uh last i
that was me saying i'm finished with the
call bro no
of course yeah all right see you guys
later let's get to it let's do it
looking forward to it
and so in the direction of shaq diesel
it was time to head to the bahamas all
that was left
was to swab my nose to prove to the
bahamian government that i didn't have
coronavirus
the only problem was my test came back
positive and this just made me really
sad because not only was i going to miss
out on this epic adventure
but as far as i was concerned i was
basically just waiting to die
and i had to interact with my family
through the glass door to the backyard
using a laser pointer and not even fat
gus would get within six feet of me
now i'm happy to say i eventually beat
the rona and tested negative but the
only problem now
is i missed my chance because they were
no longer accepting any commercial
flights from america
because we're number one baby so i was
once again
incredibly sad until i found a loophole
because while you couldn't go to the
bahamas on a public commercial flight
there were no rules against going to the
bahamas
on a private jet and since this was the
first
and last time i would ever have my own
personal g6
i acted like i've been here before like
the true professional i am
i mean mostly
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
put elon on hold and transfer to oprah
and i should mention flying across
country on your own plane isn't the most
ecologically responsible choice
so while i was in the air i utilized
this website called teamtrees.org
you might have heard of it to plant
enough trees to suck up the carbon not
only from my flight
but the next 100 flights this plane
would take
in the end it's important you guys know
i'm still super grounded and i didn't
let the experience
change me one bit and so now that i was
in the bahamas the first thing i did was
check it with my marine biologist shark
diving expert buddy luke tipple
because we need to figure out how to
somehow get blood
out of a fish
the first thought is like can you just
freaking blend a fish
give it a shot i'll be over here dude
you've clearly never seen will it blend
there's a whole youtube channel
dedicated to this
[Laughter]
okay i think if we add a little bit of
water
yeah oh yeah oh yeah
this looks like the number 32 from jamba
juice we tried a variety of other
techniques and eventually started
hitting our stride
and the buckets started filling up
[Music]
if i could smell this that looks pretty
delicious
[Music]
the good thing about mark is it's his
stupid idea but he's not making other
people do it
i respect that about me too yeah
[Applause]
i also learned this is what fish skills
look like on the inside
they're like pages in a book to increase
the surface area which maximizes the
oxygen they can pull out of the water so
we've taken about 20
fish with a little bit of help from the
blender
turn them into this farm a shark i'm
like
that's freaking delicious now that we
had five gallons of mouth-watering fish
blood smoothie
it was time to get some answers we
already know that sharks don't
necessarily go nuts in the presence of a
little bit of human blood but would they
go nuts
in the presence of a little bit of fish
blood and as a firm believer in the
scientific method
it was time to test our hypothesis by
heading out to sea
once we were far enough from land luke
and i came up with the game plan for the
experiment
basically we would have two surfboards
in the water one would have a five
gallon bucket of our fish blood smoothie
and then another would have five gallons
of human blood we would also have a
third board that just had sea water as a
control to make sure the sharks weren't
just interested in the surfboards then
we would pump out the contents of each
of the buckets over the course of an
hour
and observe how many sharks approached
each board and once we know which one
they prefer after this
we'll use that tomorrow in the cage just
to create the most wild feeding frenzy
right
which sounds super fun to me because
you're not in the cage
and so with the plan in place all that
was left to do was put the boards
together
and get them out with the sharks
[Music]
one of the limitations to last year's
test was that the boards might have been
too close to the boat so it's possible
some of the sharks
actually smelled the blood but didn't
investigate it because they were just
waiting for a handout from the boat
so this time we basically placed the
boards in the middle of the freaking
ocean
super far away from the boat so it
wouldn't be a confounding variable
oh and i should also mention we ended up
using cow's blood because it's really
hard to legally find
five gallons of human blood and after
talking with a couple shark scientists
they've shown experimentally that all
mammal blood
essentially smells the same to sharks so
it wouldn't affect the results to use
cow blood
in place of human blood so now that all
three boards were in place
we double checked to ensure each was
anchored down to the ocean floor
then i just had to start all three
custom built pumps using our custom
built remote trigger which is the exact
moment i realized
it must have got busted while being
shipped out here because it wasn't
sending a signal
which sucks because there's absolutely
no way to run the pumps manually
luckily a trick i learned while working
at nasa is you always build redundancy
into your systems just in case
so we have it in the code that if no
remote start signal is received after an
hour
each of the pumps will just
automatically start up on their own
it's just a feature we never had time to
test so we just had to firmly cross our
fingers
and hope for the best i'm hopeful we've
had to overcome a lot to get here for
this video
what's one more little challenge and at
exactly one hour
right on cue the backup code kicked in
and saved our whole experiment
with blood now officially in the water
we put the drone into the air
and started our observations
[Music]
and things were pretty quiet for about
the first 20 minutes but then we had our
first hit
on the mammal blood board shark yeah
shark face
oh yeah yeah but pretty soon thereafter
things started heating up
for the fish blood smoothie board oh my
gosh
there's one two three four five six
seven eight nine 10 11
sharks around the fish smoothie board
and then 10 minutes later
things were only more intense here you
can see the difference in activity
between the three boards and while
you're running an experiment and still
collecting data you really need to keep
an open mind
but given what we were seeing it was
getting pretty difficult
to remain objective and so after an hour
we called the experiment
and went inside to officially tally up
the results using the drone footage
and it turns out the mammal blood board
was approached eight times
the seawater control board was at zero
and the fish blood board
had a whopping 134 approaches
from a shark it definitely seems like
this fish smoothie is where it's at
right it's pretty obvious massive blob
of sharks
no sharks i think that's the go for
tomorrow for maximum feeding frenzy
now that we had a game plan for my
feeding frenzy cage the next day
we headed back to shore and to our hotel
to get some rest
for what was to come oh and fun side
note if the only way to get to a
vacation destination is by private jet
it really cuts down on the crowds
we literally had this whole resort to
ourselves
well almost to ourselves there were like
40 cats who
apparently must also fly private we woke
up bright and early the next morning
feeling refreshed
and headed right back out to sea where
luke and i prepared some massive bags of
fish blood smoothie
for me to burst open once i went down
it just seemed like a cool idea to make
a cage to get in the middle of the
fruiting frenzy
until this moment now that they're
making me put on freaking chain mail
makes me reconsider my life choices if
something terrible happens
shaq you gotta take care of my family
because this is all your fault
and after several months of prep
unfortunately
it was time for me to get in it also
just so happens
i might have forgot to mention this part
to my wife i'm not
looking under the water yet on purpose
she might have been under the impression
i was just doing another experiment with
surfboards and pumps
sorry sweetie not only was i wearing
10 pounds of steel chainmail for
protection but my vest is also filled
with 20 pounds of lead weights
that means i sank pretty fast but also
that the buoyancy to weight ratios were
perfect
for giving me practice for walking on
the moon that's one
small step because like many of you
i will definitely go to space in my
lifetime again
just haven't mentioned that to the wife
yet
all right you ready for the tip
okay the face is coming behind you right
now
now that i have the fish smoothie bags
and everyone was back at a safe distance
i just had to pop these stupid things
okay here we go
oh this is crazy what are you doing
okay the place is
there we go
oh my god
[Music]
oh
the sharks were literally trying to eat
me through the bottom of the cage so
they left me no choice
but to defend my honor yeah get out of
my cage
get out of my case i'm gonna kill you
sir
[Music]
we knew all along that the most
dangerous part would be when i exited
the cage
because they'd still be agitated and
they'd be stoked to finally have access
to the soft chewie center
so the plan was for one of the other
divers to distract them way off to the
side with the bait box
and then i would get out as silently as
possible
so they wouldn't notice me
[Music]
oh crap
that was loud
luke i need help man
going away
[Music]
for me for this experience is that
sharks have been on this planet longer
than the dinosaurs or even
trees have so they've had 400 million
years of evolution to develop these
instincts that are rewarded for smelling
fish blood humans and cows would be an
extremely rare
delicacy so it makes sense that it's not
just hardwired into their brains and so
with all my limbs intact
and with my curiosity fully satiated i
will leave you with these profound words
that in my defense
might have been the drama means speaking
as humans we're always the predator and
not really ever the prey
but this gave me a sense of what it's
like to be a tuna fish
if you're tired of staring at a screen
this summer and you're looking for some
excitement
and yet swimming with 20 sharks and a
bunch of blood seems a bit extreme
then my friends at kiwico have got you
covered as you probably know by now they
deliver these really cool monthly crates
that are designed to foster your
creativity as a maker and creator
and be super fun at the same time they
all come with really simple kid-friendly
instructions
plus all the supplies you'll need to put
it together so there's never any extra
trips to the store
each one also includes a booklet that
talks about the science principles
and where you might see examples of this
in real life lots of people have told me
i should make my own subscription box
but it just doesn't make sense
because i honestly don't know what i
would improve this is exactly how i
would do it
i'm also friends with their founder
sandra and i can vouch that she's doing
this
for all the right reasons they have
eight different crate lines that cover
the full steam spectrum from science and
engineering
to art and design geared toward all
different ages as well

sharks for not eating me
thanks to you for watching
[Music]
you
hello YouTube friends so I'm gonna tell
you guys the steps for how I made the
shower hair mural which is featured here
and yes that's made completely from
human hair which is kind of gross but
also a little bit cool my mostly girls
and I would say oh I totally thought of
this idea while I was in the shower but
um I'm guessing that was already pretty
obvious so first of all I am NOT an
artist so I actually use this picture
here to project it on the wall to make
the mural so let me tell you how I got
this picture so it's actually important
you get a good quality picture with kind
of good shadowing so this is our friend
Judy she's awesome if you live in the
Greater Los Angeles area she's an
amazing photographer and she helped me
take these shots these are some pictures
took of our family that I really really
like so anyways her imposed in the
description below so she took this
picture that kind of had the shadowing
that worked well so the key is you
select yourself the control-j that'll
put it on a different layer this is in
Photoshop by the way then go to filter
artistic cutout and use the settings
that I have there it's pretty much all
the way over the left that's going to
make an image for you that's just in
greyscale so then you hit ctrl L to
bring up the levels drag those two
sliders of the middle that'll be just
black and white but the edges are kind
of jagged II when you do this coming
from the cutout so what you do is do a
Gaussian blur of about two or so got
smooth things out then you hit ctrl M
and that brings up your curves and then
at that point you just it about what I
have an input and output and then
that'll smooth out again so you have
something you could actually work with
so at this point you can add a red
background for contrast and then here's
just another example of a picture that
works well because there's a little bit
of shadowing so if you did the same
thing steps what you swim through that's
kind of what you get but not all
pictures work well so this one's it's
kind of flat right and that's what you
get so just try and find a picture that
has good shadowing on it so that
Photoshop trick can be tweaked a little
bit and just do a ton of cool things
with like
skittles portrait of George Zimmerman so
today's at that point went up in the
bathroom and I got a projector about it
from somebody and projected on the wall
and so I kind of traced the outline in
pencil and then I started going really
fast
it's here finish that up and so now
comes the important part I found these
really cool like thinning scissors under
the sink which were great so I didn't
need a haircut yet every artist needs
his paint my wife hates that footage it
is gonna gross but that was so does kind
of like it was like a palette of hair
yeah so as you probably already guessed
that actually was my hair I used to know
my wives a little thing took me about
five hours so I kept having to spray the
hair to keep it on the wall but
eventually the water evaporate a little
bit and the hair would curl up like that
come off the wall so I put started using
Vaseline and put that on the wall and
then put the hair in that I know really
grows right and that works great but
actually two Greeks had this grand
vision of spring at the end then using
the Drano and like having the walk the
hair come down the wall but when I
sprayed it like nothing moved
so anyways there you have it I thought
it was done seriously thanks a ton for
the support I've only been making these
videos for about six months now but
everyone's been super nice and really
encouraging as you can imagine between a
family and grad school and full-time
NASA engineer gig and a couple other
side projects I've got way more ideas
than I have time to make videos but I'm
officially committing to a new video on
the first Tuesday of every month I've
got all the videos planned out through
2012 now and they're all original and if
I could pull some of these off I
honestly think you guys will like them
better than any of the junk I've posted
so far finally I haven't mentioned this
before on here but they have a public
Facebook and Twitter account the details
are in the description below so you know
time to make a ton of videos every month
sometimes I'll post something short and
simple up on one of those guys so yeah
go like and follow and tell your friends
and family about this new friend you met
on YouTube that sometimes makes creepy
videos that
here and you stay classy San Diego
crap I have to wash this off I really
should have thought that through better
you
Oh My Gosh
It Looks Like A Pill
Oh My Gosh What The?
(Mark) You Wanna Know How I Did It (Kid) How?
So I'm Going To Make A Video About This Right? Then In A Couple Of Weeks I'm Going Put It On YouTube Then Watch The Video And See How I Did It
oh my goshhh
*laughs*
OH MY GOSHHHHH
*Xbox achievement sound effect*
So A While Back I Made A Video On How You Can Use A Coat Hanger And A Drill To Make A Watermelon Smoothie
And A Bunch Of You Said You Did It And Told Me Everyone And Your Party Thought It Was Awesome All But Yet Slightly Creepy
So This Is Another Watermelon Party Trick
And The Key Is To Start With 2 Watermelons That Are Similar In Shape And Size
And Then You Just Want To Make A Bunch Of Shallow Straight Cuts Until There Is No Green Left
And Then For Round 2 You Want Harness Your Inner  Fruit Ninja And Just Make A Bunch Of Little Slices Until There Is Only Red Left
And This Looks Okay But The Problem Is You Can Still See A Lot Of Edges From The Flat Cuts
But Some Brand New Dish Scrubbing Pads Make For Great Watermelon Sandpaper
And Then It Gets Super Smooth
So The Second Watermelon Is Pretty Straight Forward You Just Cut It In 2 Halves
Cut It Using Your Favorite Method
This Is Watermelon You Can Actually Eat Later At The Party At Well
and then carve out
both halves
so the coolest part is now you can put
it back together and take it to the
party like this just don't forget to
chilling for it and this totally works
for any size watermelon and you can get
creative - this is sort of like an
impossible ship in a bottle type of
concept
depending on the size your watermelon
average prep time is about ten minutes
which is less time than making most
other summer party dishes like gross and
lame potato salad which let's face it
nobody really likes
plus it's way cooler because once people
are done in firing your artwork you can
slice it up and it's super easy to eat
because there's no Ryan to clean up much
watermelon or you can just go barbarian
get a big bite before I show myself
getting undeservedly ganged up on I want
to take audible for sponsoring this
video I'm a fan of learning to be more
creative and I just finished listening
to creativity Inc by Ed Catmull who is
the founder of Pixar and widely known as
being a brilliant leader in it he mainly
talks about all the failures they went
through creating each of their hip films
he focuses on how to create teams that
truly foster personal creativity and
innovation so if you work on a team that
needs more innovation and you want to
listen to this book or any book for free
all you have to do is use the link of
the description or go to audible.com
slash mark rober those who know me can
vouch that I listen to audio books all
the time just because it's super
convenient especially if you have any
kind of commute over five minutes my
sweet watermelon shades
Oh
yeah
[indistinct shouting]
- No steal. There's no steal there. I predict not a steal, watch this:
...and he stayed.
[excited]
He's gonna steal! This is a steal!
If this app works, this kid's about to steal!
[excited squealing]
There he goes!
Freakin' works!
It works.
Two years ago I came up with an idea for an app where you could decode baseball signs
So you would know when the other team was going to steal, even after just the first inning.
Then in a covert effort to get people more interested in coding the machine learning,
I would make the app free and available to everyone. 
I'm happy to report...
It's no longer just an idea.
Today I'm going to show you exactly how the app works, and we'll use it in the wild,
and then we're going to talk about machine learning in very simple terms with my buddy Jabril.
But first, to set the stage we need to understand the fascinating world of secret baseball signs.
It's the game within the game.
Most people know the catcher will give signs to the pitcher when your team is on defense.
But when you're on offense, the third-base coach gives signs to both the batter and the base runner.
For example, he could secretly tell the batter to bunt, or to not swing at the next pitch,
or he can tell the base runner to steal.
And just to be clear, stealing a base is when you start running as soon as the pitches thrown,
instead of waiting for the batter to try and hit it.
It's risky because if the batter doesn't hit the ball and the catcher is good,
he can throw you out at second base.
Because it's a big advantage, coaches will actually tell their players to watch
and see if they could figure out the other team's signs. 
That's considered a fair play and it's part of the game.
The problem is, our brains aren't great at figuring out the complex pattern.
So we set out to create an app that would use machine learning to do exactly that. And by we, I mean
Jabril actually sat down and wrote the code and I just made sure he had unlimited Cheez-Its and Lacroix.
Here's how it works: 
If I saw coach touched his nose, ears, arm, chin, and so on, I would assign those to letters in the app.
Then I'll just watch him sign and record the order. After that I would just let the app know the outcome;
so was it a steal or not. 
After you do this for enough sequences, the app will start to make predictions.
In this case, it's predicting the combination of "A, D", or "nose then chin" is their steal sign.
This worked well enough on my workbench,
so now it's time for the first real-world test 
in a kids-versus-adults Wiffle Ball game.
And my friend Sara takes the game of Wiffle Ball pretty seriously,
so she was the captain of the kids team, and was signaling for them to steal at just the right moments.
[Cheering]
- And I wasn't sure about the ethics of using our app against a bunch of little kids,
but they were scoring runs and stealing bases with impunity, and then they got so confident, they started talking trash.
[kids screaming]
WE WANT A PITCHER,
NOT A BELLY ITCHER!
And no one says that about my pitcher,
so at that point the gloves came off.
We found it easiest to film her signs with our phone, and then scrub through and capture the order in the app afterwards,
as opposed to trying to do it real-time.
And I'm very happy to report we cracked their code after only three sequences.
And what's cool is once you know the code, you no longer need the app because you can just watch for the steal signal
and when we saw it, we alerted our pitcher with the secret sign of our own
[music]
[screaming]
Ayyyyy! You're outta there buddy!
And after that the tides of the game shifted and we were able to officially prove adults rule, and kids drool.
So our app cracked the code after just three sequences and I'm going to show you them
to see if you can figure out the steal sign using just your brain.
Here's the first one:
And this was a STEAL.
Here's the second:
And this was NO STEAL.
And this is the third:
And it was a STEAL.
Pause and go back if you want to try and figure it out, because I'm about to tell you the answer.
According to the app, which Sara later confirmed,
their steal sign was only if she touched her hat and then left ear back to back.
Everything else was just a decoy.
Now before we tell you exactly how the app can figure this out so quickly,
we need a little background information.
So I've cornered my buddy Jabril here and I'm gonna make him give us a super simple explanation of machine learning.
Now here's what you should know about Jabril: He's basically a genius who taught himself how to code when he was 14.
He has an amazing YouTube channel you should check out with videos like this one
where he made a video game where the character teaches himself how to navigate any maze
using machine learning and neural networks.
[Jabril]
 - All right. Let's say we have Timmy here. And Timmy likes certain type of toys, but not others.
So in a fake example here, he decides his based on how big the toy is and how complicated it is.
So, from small to big, and then over here
how many parts it has; from just one piece, to a really complex toy with gears and moving parts and things like that.
And so, if we asked Timmy about 20 different toys and start to plot those on the graph,
we'll start to see a pattern.
So generally, he likes toys that are big and complicated, but does not like toys that are small and simple.
And so, by looking at his past preferences,
we can make really good predictions for the future.
If you show little Timmy here a toy that is this complicated
and this big, we're confident that he'll like it before we show it to him because it is inside the "like" boundaries.
That's the big deal with machine learning:
We don't have to take the time and show a little Timmy here every toy that's ever been created
and record his answers. After we record some
likes and dislikes we're able to draw some boundaries.
And precisely where we draw these boundaries is the secret sauce.
In this case, with just two inputs,
You can just eyeball it and see where to put the boundaries.
Butt
...when you have thousands of inputs that interact with each other, it's
impossible for our brains to comprehend where those boundaries should go.
However, it's pretty trivial for a computer using machine learning.
[Mark]
 - In doing research for this video, I talked to probably over 50 baseball players and coaches.
And when we asked about signs, it was surprising to me how they all basically use the same strategy.
See if you can pick up on it.
[Coach]
 - Every coach has an indicator.
- I have an indicator so I could do all this, you know
random stuff like this, touch anywhere until I touch this, none of that matters.
- So it'll be an indicator and the next sign, that's the 'hot' sign.
So it's indicator, arm is 'steal', if I just do arm, that's nothing.
- Oftentimes, I'll give this
'Simon didn't say'.
If I go indicator, and then immediately to anywhere on my arm:
Steal.
Bunt is to the belt; indicator to the belt.
[Mark]
 - So basically nothing matters and it's all a decoy until they touch the indicator, and then
the very next sign is the instruction.
So after the indicator you might be told to bunt,
or to take a pitch,
or to steal.
And so since the steal sign comes immediately after the indicator, We just look at a sequence where steal was recorded here
That's showing us one and we look through that sequence two letters of the time and store those combos and we do the same thing
for all the
Sequences where steal was recorded and whatever two letter combo shows up in all of them is their indicator and steal sign in this case
It's a D. So if we decode that that means noses their indicator and chin is their steal sign now
I have a confession what I just showed you doesn't use machine learning at all. It's just a simple algorithm
We realized at work
once we discovered that pretty much all teams will use an indicator directly before
Giving the real sign but based off all the people we talked to you if you're trying to decode signs this simple version should work
Like ninety percent of the time but what about the other 10% where they do anything other than indicator followed by sign?
That's where you need machine learning because I've done properly machine learning can crack any code as long as you give it enough training data
So to really see how good Jabril x' machine learning app was I generated some training data based off an insanely?
Complicated steals line I came up with to see if he could figure it out
so my secret sign was a mustache rub is the indicator followed by any random sign and then a tooth tap as
The steal sign then I can have up to fifty different
Signals in each sequence and then to throw them off even more if I ever touch my right, eyebrow
It's not a steal
So you ignore everything in the sequence?
Even if i've already given this deal now just to set the stage if we weren't going to use machine learning
This would take a normal computer
Thousands of years to solve because it's the same as if you're asking Timmy about every toy ever made instead of just drawing the boundaries
Before we see if gibreel can successfully crack my code and how long it will take him
Let's just go one layer deeper than the Timmy toy example and see how machine learning
Mimics the human brain in creating neural networks that can draw those boundaries in the more complicated case of more than two inputs
There are three main parts to a neural network and hang with me here because I'm going to keep this simple
You have the input layer which in our case are the signs being given and then way over here
You have the output layer in our case steel or no steel and then in the middle
We have the hidden layers and right now that's just a black box
So if the sign was hat hat nose hand
We would tweet these input knobs like this depending on how each of these knobs is turned
Each one is interconnected with the knobs to its left
So it causes some simple math to occur at each node
And when you sum up all of those numbers
You're left with a number between 0
And 1 and if that number is really close to 0 that's no steal
And if the number is really close to 1 that's a steal so you give it a bunch of training data
We're given an input
You know what the output should be you start with these hidden layer knobs turned in totally random directions
And when you add them all up you get something like point five five. Well, that doesn't make sense
You can't have half a steel and more importantly with the training data
you know the answers and you know that this
Combination should have been a steel
So you just start tweaking these hidden layer knobs until you start to get
Outputs that are more correct over time and after going through a bunch of examples where you know what the answer should be
Eventually, you get to a point where any more tweaking of the knobs just makes it less accurate
so you stop so now you
Superglue these three hidden layer knobs into place because you've trained your model
And so now with the brand-new input where you don't know the answer it gives you the correct output in this case us steel
Of course, this is a simple model
But this scales up so you could have thousands of inputs and thousands of outputs and you're able to discover really?
complicated relationships
What's so cool about this is this is basically how neural networks in our own
Rains are set up to learn once
I've been given enough training data to understand the interaction between my hand and arm and keeping something balanced like this then my model is
Trained and I superglue those middle knobs in my brain, then I can introduce a totally new input
I've never tried before and I still know what to do
I don't need to be trained on every possible
different type of object because my brain
Has drawn the boundaries think about that for a long time before machine learning in neural networks computers were just following
hard-coded instructions given by humans now
they can learn like humans only they can do it much faster and more comprehensively than we can look at Ori and
That's why when I give Jabril the challenge that would take a normal computer using brute force methods thousands of years to solve
Yo, man
Please tell me that your indicator is a moustache rub and then you know, whatever and
Then it do that
Is that it
Jibril's machine learning algorithm just created the right boundaries and solved it in less than three minutes
The machine learning model requires more data than our simple version which can solve it after like three sequences
But the upside is that it will eventually decode any set of signs. As long as you're capturing the inputs, right?
And so now it was time for a real-life test. So I asked my buddy Destin to do some secretive recon work
Okay, dude, this is the field. I used to play it growing up today. My son is playing on the Rascals
I'm gonna go film on third base coaches doing their thing and we'll plug all that data into the machine learning algorithm
These kids are yelling at me
Want me to know what my channel is and the fact they didn't recognize him just proved to me that whatever was happening in this
Region was a totally effective disguise and thanks to Dustin's great interviews in raw footage
We were able to get even more data to show that methods totally worked
And while Destin just brazenly set up a tripod and filmed all these third-base coaches
Yeah, cuz signs are pretty secret, right yeah, yes, sir get it
I get in trouble for stealing sons
I was a little more nervous and discreet if you put a GoPro in a cup
you can actually just watch the footage and frame the shot real time and it just looks like your check and dank means with the
Drink in your hand. I've actually used this trick a few times especially on my Carnival scam science video
So just like with Destin's footage
It worked perfectly the games I went to and it was just a cool feeling once you'd crack their code
To be able to predict exactly what was coming next
I
Hope you enjoyed this excuse to learn more about machine learning as much as I did
I will put links to both versions of the app in the video
description for you to check out and of course if there are specific rules against using
Technology to steal science in your league. I am not telling you to break them. Otherwise from personal experience
You might risk getting some very important people mad at you
I
Recently took a trip to the Bahamas to visit some sharks for an upcoming video on the way there
I noticed some suspicious YouTube account activity
So I did what you should never do while using
Unsecured public Wi-Fi and I changed my master YouTube password as in the password where if you had it?
You could delete all of my videos and the reason I was not at all worried to do important things over
Unsecure public Wi-Fi was because I was using Nord VPN. So unlike probably everyone else at the airport
I knew I was fully encrypted and protected and anonymous
It's a game changer for me when I travel not only for online protection
But all my favourite websites worked the exact same as if I was at home and Norview PN is the best because it's super fast
with thousands of servers in over 61 countries and unlimited bandwidth
So if you find yourself using unsecured public Wi-Fi in hotels or coffee shops or airports or give in today's headlines
You're just ready to start taking a privacy more. Seriously you go to north VPN
calm slash mark Grover or use the link in the video description for
75% there are three year plans which works out to less than three bucks a month
So it's Norview pn comm slash mark rover and use the code marker over at checkout
So they know I sent you and they'll throw in an extra month free. Thanks for watching
I texted this clip to my wife who wanted proof
I wasn't doing anything stupid on a recent trip to the Bahamas
Now if you're wondering what my feet are doing in shark-infested waters with a bucket of blood 20 miles away from any land
Well, that comes down to a conversation. I had with my friends at the Discovery Channel six months ago
They told me Shark Week is coming up and they want to know what I would do
if they could put me in the middle of the ocean on a boat surrounded by sharks for as long as I can remember
I've always wanted to test if sharks can really smell a drop of blood in the water from a mile away
Now before you say Mythbusters already did this
They kind of did this as you can see to test this they poked their fingers and then stuck them in a barrel with these
Tiny lemon sharks and since they didn't really seem to turn around and look at their fingers
They said it was busted now
I'm friends with both Kari and Adam, but I think even they would have been at least in this case
The methodology was less than scientifically rigorous
so I came up with a more robust test procedure built some NASA great hardware for the experiment hopped on a plane and then a
Speedboat and soon enough. I was 20 miles offshore of the Bahamas
To kick things off I sat down with my marine biologist shark diving expert friend Luke Tipple and explained my plan in eventually
Eventually I plan to test just how far they could smell a single drop of blood in the water
But first I wanted proof that they actually preferred blood over any other scent
So for my first experiment
I plan to put four surfboards in the water equa-distant from the back of the boat
each board would host two litres of a different liquid that we would pump into the ocean over the course of an hour then using
A three meter radius around each board as a gauge we would use drone footage and count how many sharks went over to check out?
Each board. So this board would be fish oil, which I heard was a general attractant for lots of fish
Then we would have cows blood here
Then sea water here as a control to make sure the Sharks weren't just interested in the surfboard and then finally urine I've heard
From surfers that a lot of them won't pee in their wetsuits because they feel like it's gonna attract a shark
I don't know a surfer alive who doesn't pee in their wetsuit.
But yes that's definitely something that I've heard, a lot.
It'll liberate surfers everywhere, if we show it's cool to pee in your wet suit.
And so after a bit more discussion Luke was on board for the first of our two experiments
Well as a firm believer in the scientific method, we'll test it out
And then you'll dive
Well, depending on the results I dive
If I can't pee, then the deal's off
And so with that we started putting the four boards together
[Music]
We also started collecting scientific donations from the crew
All right, so now it's time to fill these bags. Mm-hmm, what do you want to do first - pee or blood?
Yeah, let's do pee. Okay, let's do rock-paper-scissors for who holds the bucket and who holds the bag
Alright, one two three shoot?
Ohh I gotta strategize... okay I know I know
One two three shoot.
Yeaaaa. Dammit
Ohh that smells so bad
It's urine
Whosever's it is, they need to hydrate - dude this is going to be a nightmare.
Oh it's warm
Your pouring sucks!
Okay
Oh that smell of
All in the name of science
That's a great time of day to be doing this cuz we have a lot of sharks looking down here
we got three or four lemons on the surface and I can actually see two Tigers
down on the bottom and that's actually a massive tiger shark
That is huge
All right, see if you can do it better job pouring than I did. Oh
my gosh
Oh wow. There's a feeding frenzy
It's fine
What do you mean don't move it? I almost lost my hands
They're not gonna jump out of the water.
Okay, so we've got sea water as our control, fish oil,  we have urine, and cows blood
So while Luke is bravely swimming the four surfboards out and anchoring them in place in preparation for the one hour countdown
Now is a perfect time to explain the cool tech on each board
I designed and built from scratch with my buddy Shawn Hodgins
For this experiment to be robust
All four boards need to start pumping at the exact same time after Luke has them in place
That means we need to somehow start the pumps using a radio signal from the boat
so each surfboard has a waterproof receiver box like this that also hosts the battery, a custom printed circuit board, and two Arduinos
Then I have the remote control and as soon as I hit this button
[mechanical whirring]
They all start pumping at the same time
We know each pump is working because the corresponding yellow light is lit up
That's important because they're too far away from the boat to see if they're functioning properly
To pump the blood and pee
We're using a peristaltic pump
this is a perfect choice because it's a totally sterile way to get the blood from the bag to the
Ocean since the blood never touches any sort of valve or something
It just has these rollers that sort of pinch and push the blood through the tubing in a manner that just happens to be similar
To a severed artery
And so with the board's in place
It was go time
operation shark bait test thing commence -  three two one... beep
All four going we have confirmation
Everything is rolling. The experiment is underway. We'll, let them go for an hour just dripping stuff out
And yea we'll see what happens.
And after ten minutes I was really surprised there wasn't a lot of action on any of the boards
So so far. It's pretty interesting
I mean we've shown if you have a massive cut and you're bleeding out and there's this many sharks within like
50 yards of you that they're kind of like 'meh' so like already that's an interesting finding, right?
You would think like a little bit of blood and there would just be a massive swarm
But that's not the case so far
And to be clear we weren't dealing with small quantities here the human body contains five liters of blood and after you use
Two liters, which is the exact amount. We're putting in the water then you die
About 20 minutes in things were still pretty quiet, especially at the fish oil urine and control boards
But then the blood board started attracting some smaller fish and soon after one or two sharks started taking notice
Not a lot of love for my pee. I don't know why I find that kind of offensive, but I'm just a little hurt
Eventually with about 15 minutes left things started getting pretty wild over by the blood board
The blood was spread out and made almost like a blood run way
So you have the surreal line of sharks swimming up this
Enticing blood trail one after another only to be super disappointed to find a big piece of styrofoam
We're almost done
Three-two-one, the motors have stopped our experiment is done. I just like to point out the bags have been sucked dry
So the engineering part of this experiment
was flawless
Gunshot everywhere. Yeah, no to super pissed off targets
and so now it's time to go in and review the footage and get a final tally for each board and what we found was
that four sharks went to check out the fish oil then zero sharks went to check out both the control and
The urine and then the blood board had a direct visit from a whopping
41 sharks
and so now that we debunked some surfing myths about
Urine and proved that sharks certainly had a strong preference for blood over anything we tested the real question was
Just how much blood is interesting to them and there was one part of the experimental design
That was really nagging at me. Cuz that was cows blood right that was cows blood. You wanna try human
At least 10 living braiding blood bags around here
Not everyone was luke and I about this idea
Yeah, and then just draw will just have fresh blood just mainline it and put it in the water one up. Would you be down?
Moondog, what do you reckon look at me?
So Luke made some calls and soon enough we had an amazing certified bhajami and phlebotomist on board
And after some generosity from the camera crew and even captain Scotty
We had four bulging bags of human blood for our second experiment
This is my actual blood free to see if sharks have a taste for it
And if they do I probably won't go three dining with them for the second experiment. We had three boards again
We placed the control in the middle the board over here would pump the human blood
Slowly at one drop a minute and then on the other side this board would pump the blood fast on
average one drop every four seconds we were able to do that because another cool feature for the boxes we built was that by turning
This knob you can control the flow rate
So over time they can pump out different amounts and because sometimes we all have to step up and just do our part while Luke
Once again risked his life by placing the three boards. I'd prepared to push a button
All right, all of them are popular and good to go now the clock is ticking
So we have like fifty five more minutes to go
We'll see if the Sharks notice there
One drop of human blood every four seconds may sound like a lot and it certainly is but it's also important to note
That's 40 times less than the first experiment where we saw so much activity in this case halfway in to experiment number two
Even though there were tons of sharks still in the area. The boards themselves were pretty quiet
We'll have to see when we look at the footage afterwards. But so far it looks like the answer's no
Five four three two one
Experiments over
and so after the full hour we brought in the board's and once again reviewed the footage to see that over the course of an
hour zero sharks two checked out the control board zero checked out the slow blood pumping board and
Exactly zero sharks checked out the fast one
So this is by no means a perfect experiment
but I think it's safe to
Qualitatively say that if no sharks came to check out 15 drops of human blood a minute in the middle of shark-infested
Waters and probably gonna be okay with a small scrape
I mean there certainly won't be some kind of feeding frenzy with a single drop of blood from all sharks within a mile
Now that I had some first-hand data to put my mind at ease
I was willing to try diving with the sharks without a cage, but I had one final experiment
I had a theory that if we secured a
360 camera to the front of a hand spear and then shot it near some sharks
We could create the world's first really cool matrix, like underwater bullet time effect. So I suited up
and goddamn I
Like theory proved correct on the whole time ham spirit because as you can see that footage
What I'll take home from this shoot is just more evidence of
the amazing animal that sharks are but also the ability to point people in a specific direction to say
Hey your thoughts about them are a little overblown this experience. Definitely changed my perception on sharks
I would say I respect them more after seeing their raw power up close at the same time
There's less of that fear that comes from ignorance on top of all that I didn't die
14 years ago when I was just a wee lad working for NASA. I remember getting my first ever bonus check for some work
I did on the rover my whole life. I'd always wanted a really nice pair of headphones
So I splurged and got these bad boys. So the Bose QuietComfort 15 s and as you can see I have used them extensively
For the past 14 years
Especially when traveling in preparation for this trip to the Bahamas both sent me some of their brand new headphones 700s
So I used them for the whole trip and for the past couple weeks now, you should know both supported this video
But they didn't give me any
specific talking points to say besides
tell people what you honestly think and so after using them for two weeks what I
honestly think is that if this represents my old headphones
This represents my new ones these things are a total GameChanger
And so here's what I think are the four coolest features first off
The noise cancelling is insane without actually trying these on it's really hard to demonstrate on video. But here's my best attempt this week
The candlelight but you were to comb it I answered all these headphones this is exactly what my voice would sound like number two
They are totally wireless with a battery charge of twenty hours. This was plenty for me. Never even to get close to stranded
But if you do run it all the way down, they utilize quick charging
So 15 minutes of charge time from a totally dead battery gives you three to half hours of listening and if your battery is somehow
Totally dead with no way to charge you just open this clever
Compartment and then you just plug them in and then you can still use them as passive wired headphones number three
They have hands-free mode. So you never need to pull your phone out of your pocket
Hey Alexa, play songs by hand rapidly
You can also use the touch sensitive side to pause and skip songs and change the volume
And finally, one of the coolest features is conversation mode
this gives you super hearing and uses all four mics to actually pass in all the sounds from around you so you can actually have
a conversation with someone without having to take them off and so while I'm no mkbhd
That's my tech review. I love these things and they're super comfortable
It's like wearing a pair of clouds over your ears that can totally block out the outside world
But also happen to have amazing sound quality. So thanks to Bose for making an amazing product and thanks to you for watching
so I remember reading a long time ago that people actually swerve more to hit turtles on the road then they would snakes. And as
a firm believer in the scientific method I decided to test out this hypothesis
So I got a rubber turtle and a rubber snake I also got a rubber tarantula to spice things up a little bit. I basically
alternated placing each on the shoulder of the Road and
I
counted cars and
meticulously collected data
So here's what I found
Put into my relatively small sample size about thousand cars
ninety-four percent of all drivers are totally boring. They didn't do anything
They just drove by, but the remaining six percent are cold-blooded rubber animal killers
So now if we take this 6% and we break it down
Tarantulas definitely got the most next was snakes and then turtles so as you can see right here
We have to reject our hypothesis snakes actually get run over more than turtles so don't believe everything you read
so we also had a leaf here nobody hit it and I use that as a control but since it was 0% on the leaf
You can assume that these pretty much were intentional hits. Killers vehicle of choice trucks and Suv
89% very Few were actually cars
so occasionally someone would be cool and they would stop and pull over and
Save what they thought was a real animal, and you can see here turtles. Definitely got saved the most and then snakes
Tarantulas. I'm gonna be honest you need a new P.R. firm you got saved
exactly as many times as somebody saved the leaf which is none usually they would just stop and throw rocks at you and
Then run you over anyways
so of the animal Savers
96% totally cool people
there's even one lady who pulled over to save the snake and
She started bowling with plums
And the actions here from this guy from animal control
Really serves as an important reminder that you cannot be too cautious when dealing with the rubber turtle
four percent however are
Pony tailed science haters, so you see this guy right, pulls over
he's being cool. He's gonna save the snake that's cool, but then he starts to walk off with it, so I let him know "hey
That's my snake"
"I'm right here." Now, I know this might be a bit surprising based off his appearance
but in hindsight,"I'm trying to do some science here" I might have overestimated his love of the sciences, so
even though we disproved our hypothesis. It's kind of a fun experiment, and it actually kind of got me thinking
What's up with this 1%? what kind of person actually hits a turtle even the cartoons the turtles are always the nice ones
Wait a second
pull that clip back
Now play it forward
Freeze zoom in on the driver and go ahead and run the enhance algorithm
What do you mean? There's no such thing?
This is Hollywood if you use a fancy word like algorithm. You can pretty much do whatever you want
Have you ever even seen an episode of CSI?
Just as I suspected
Up to your old tricks again a shredder you crazy old coot
It's time to let it go old friend. Let it go
Finally zoom in on that backseat run the shadow lightning on multiplexer
multiplexer mmM
Is Bebop and Rocksteady the classic blundering sidekicks?
So I've always been blessed with an abundance of hair follicles
in the brow region and ever since my personal discovery of tweezers between the 11th and 12th grades
I've long suspected that people without unibrow actually get treated better by the general population.
so as a firm believer in the scientific method I decided to test out this hypothesis
So I went to my hollywood makeup artist buddy, Dennis, and he hooked me up with a killer unibrow
and then I went out and I would engage people and then just ask them an open-ended question and
Generally when I would walk away things like this would happen a lot
But as a control for the experiment I also went out with no unibrow to the exact same locations wearing the exact same clothes,
asking the exact same questions.
You know if a good place to eat around here
So for example. This is response with no unibrow
But [that's] really good well. Thank you and
Then here's the response with the unibrow
do you know a good place to eat around here.
Now this represents a relatively small sample size of about 200 people
But here's what I found without the unibrow the average response was about 33 words long
But with the unibrow the average response was only 16 words long.
so we have to accept our hypothesis that unibrow discrimination
is in fact very real.
Which is crazy
because that
Basically means people will be more than twice as willing to engage in a conversation with you based strictly on whether or not you have
A well-established gap of hair between here and here on your face.
so another interesting observation
Was in cases where I [had] the unibrow a person by themselves would respond with an average of 18 words
But if it was a group the average number of words from the entire group was only 14
And if you do have prominent brow hair one final bit of advice is if you approach a group of teenage girls
Thirtyfive percent of the time when you walk away, they will try and discreetly take your picture without realizing
they're being filled by three separate cameras.
here I am.
and here
I am about ten seconds away from lining in the Instagram feed of nine hundred of her closest friends
So according to the data having a unibrow will in fact negatively influence your social interactions with other people.
uh, (I mean), I knew it
who even let him.
look away. I'm hideous I
(bert)
I knew there was a reason I've been living with another man for forty years.
*laughs* Hey, that's why I always just kind of assumed
Nevermind the point is you can do something about this
now you promise this won't hurt, right?
aaaaaah
aah
aaah
Hey, not bad
these massive drones are attempting to
plant 20 million trees from the sky but
find out how I ended up here in the
middle of this forest we need to go back
six months because that's when mr. bees
hit 20 million subs and someone
suggested to celebrate he should plant
20 million trees it went super viral on
Reddit and Twitter at which point
someone else suggested he should team up
with me and a bunch of other youtubers
to make it happen which got me thinking
and so with that these guys are talking
a big game like they know what they're
doing but go do it impromptu pull tests
first of all I don't love the angle can
I just say that Wow
[Music]
we've been planning all day solid eight
hours we're up to like 250 trees so I
mean it's a start
definitely a start can you say look
who's the dirtiest I saw you rubbing my
bat kills there's a field of trees 300
you know after a full day of planning
300 less than 20 million so after
talking it over we decided we would play
to our strengths Jimmy was gonna try and
solve our problem with a tweet
recruiting thousands of people and I was
gonna pursue a more robotic station and
so with that I made my way further up
the coast of Washington using a shortcut
I knew to see if I can uncover a way to
plant trees from the sky but before I
get into that have you ever thought
about where trees actually get their
mass from the knee-jerk reaction is to
think it comes from the soil but that
can't be true because if you have a tree
in a big pot as the tree gets bigger the
soil level doesn't go down at all the
answer as it turns out is that the mass
comes from thin air the clues if you
look at what the bulk of the tree is
actually made of it's almost entirely
carbon pretend I'm a tree basically a
tree sees a carbon dioxide molecule
floating by then it powers up your
energy from the Sun using photosynthesis
then it uses that energy to rip the
carbon from the oxygen and it takes that
carbon and slaps it on itself to get
more swoll and the trees like hey humans
here's some beautiful fresh oxygen you
can have that I don't need it so it
takes the sea and leaves us with the o2
that's a sweet deal and so trees start
really small but in order to get bigger
and bigger they're just sucking more and
carbon out of the air so now you can see
a tree and appreciate the beauty in the
shade but also that they're just these
really massive vacuum bags completely
stuffed full of carbon and so I was in
Washington to meet with some people who
had a crazy idea that just might be the
key to helping mr. beast and I plant
those twenty million carbon vacuums well
the company's called drones EDA and
they're only about four years old and
their idea is to use these massive
drones to plant trees from the sky they
do this in two steps first they send out
a smaller recon drone that uses lasers
to create a 3d map of the terrain and
then from that that you software to find
all the best spots to drop the trees to
maximize their survivability and then
they create a flight path for each of
the drones to fly autonomously then you
load up the drone with a bunch of these
seed pucks that you'll drop from the sky
and their design is super clever too
because in each puck represented by a
hockey puck in this case there's a
special cocktail of around six seeds
specifically chosen for the area where
they're planning and then you have
nutrients sort of like a fertilizer that
will help the seed grow and keep it from
drying out and because you don't want to
put two squirrels or my is just making a
buffet out of all the CG drop you need
some way to condition them to give the
whole experience just a one star review
the ghost peppers they're an Olaf actor
and gustatory deterrent which means if
you eat it you know the obvious reaction
and on the way out is the same thing I
talked about last night at some
gustatory and then once you secure the
puck dropper to the drone it's time to
fly light the fires kick the tires
[Music]
like mechanized poop in some ways this
sort of like mimics mother nature right
because like a bird eats a seed it flies
it poops it and there's like nourishment
around that seed yes that's exactly what
it is biomimicry and this is brutal
terrain
you wouldn't be wanting to walk down in
here so real the access is from the sky
is a really big deal
after wildfires we used to rely on
Mother Nature to do reforestation for us
but due to some factors related to
climate change 40% of the time now we're
seeing tall shrubs grow back instead of
big old trees that can literally suck up
tons of carbon and that's an example
where drones are perfect because they
can get in right away and start planting
trees in the smoldering remains where
it's too dangerous for humans to be on
the ground even with only three drones
you can reef or San areas six times
faster than a normal planting crew if
you can nail a fleet like this with just
three you can just scale this up you can
imagine the potential where you know you
have a swarm of a hundred drones the
worked Road seat is doing is awesome it
gives me so much hope when I see people
use really cool technology to solve
really big problems but they're still
fine-tuning their system before they
massively scale up so they just aren't
going to be able to help us plant the 20
million trees in time which is why we've
been talking with all our YouTube
creator friends for the past five months
and we decided if we were actually going
to plant 20 million trees by 2020 you
need to bring the entire YouTube
community together I'm stoked let's
plant some trees
it could be one of the craziest things
that YouTube is embassy there's so many
people we could end up with too many
trees we're calling it team trees and we
went through a bunch of different
options on how to pull this off and
eventually settled on working with the
Arbor Day Foundation they're the longest
running most well-respected tree
planting nonprofit and we made a deal
with them that for every dollar we give
them they would plant one tree
it's basically magic and I had to prove
that to my buddy Thomas it's a dollar
I'm gonna call my buddy Zach King here
Zach king oh hi mark
hey Zach we've got a dollar for you oh
okay so you take the dollar put in some
dirt and then pull oh you get a tree oh
wow it's like and so despite mine and
mr. beets best effort we need your help
because to play of 20 million trees
we're really looking to raise twenty
million dollars that's just an insane
goal especially when you only have two
short ones to pull it off but starting
today you're going to see the entire
YouTube community come together on this
like you've never seen before I would
plant at least a couple of trees the
reason I'm most excited about this is it
feels like the end of Power Rangers when
they would all assemble into the big
thing and fight stuff together and do
good this will absolutely be historic
and we need you on Team trees this is
our chance to end this decade on a super
strong note it's a constructive way to
tell the policymakers that this
generation and our community on YouTube
truly cares about the environment is
basically all of us joining together to
give a massive fist bump to freaking
mother Kirk I personally will be
planting 50,000 trees by donating
$50,000 but that's still way less than
20 million so join me and mr. beast and
all your favorite YouTube creators by
clicking that blue button right over
there and planting as many trees as you
can afford right now we honestly need
you if you're working adults consider
how many trees you willing to plants to
send a message your kid talk to your
parents about this get creative and do
some chores to earn some money ask for
some freaking trees for Christmas you
can pick up twenty-minute soda cans and
then recycle them and that's
one more tree that will exist in the
world that if you wouldn't have done
that
this is all hands on deck so either
click that blue button or go to team
trees org and turn your dollars into
trees and then for like the next two
months make sure you like and DoubleTap
and retweet anything having to do with
team trees and harass your favorite
creators to join if they somehow haven't
already and so now in exchange for
joining team trees if you've ever
wondered how we really know climate
change is occurring stick with me for
two minutes because I'm gonna break it
down real simple using this column of
ice a while back scientists went down to
Antarctica and drilled out a bunch of
ice cores like this and what's cool is
that because ice layers up over time the
really old ice is at the bottom and the
newer ice is on top as you know ice
traps air bubbles so as you move your
way down the column you get these little
pristine pockets of air going back and
talk what they found is that co2 levels
in the atmosphere naturally fluctuate
from about 200 to 300 but then starting
with the Industrial Revolution we
started burning way more coal which is
made from dead trees and we started
burning down forests for resources to
keep pace with a growing population the
problem with both of these is we're
taking all this carbon that was in the
ground in these massive carbon vacuum
bags and we're putting it back into the
air at a super unnatural rate so much so
that around 1950 we busted into the 300s
for the first time in at least a million
years and we weren't done yet because
just four years ago in 2015 we broke
into the 400s when I started writing the
script for this video we were at 411
today we're at 412 and this is the
actual curd data from NASA's excellent
website which does a great job laying
out all the data they've gathered on
climate change a lot of my old friends
at NASA played a role in collecting this
data now here's the punchline and why
all of this matters if you independently
look at average temperature over the
past million years and then overlay it
with average co2 in the atmosphere they
match up pretty much exactly so this
relatively sudden spike of all the co2
in the air is not a good thing and sure
enough right now we are consistently
breaking the hottest month on Earth
Records which has a lot of knock-on
effects which will start snowballing
unless we can band together and reverse
the trend and it's important to note
with regards to team trees that 20
million trees by 2020 isn't going to
cure climate change but
step in the right direction and a
constructive positive way to send the
message that we see the science and we
care so thanks for watching and thanks
for doing your part to make a difference
I am so stoked we totally got this I
want to give a massive shout out to
Wick's who supported the making of this
video I warned them that this was going
to be the worst converting ad read in
history because I was going to send
everyone a way to donate before I got to
this part so to the five of you that
made it this far please make a mental
Dona brain right here under the week's
category that says they're one of the
good guys
and I love them and I've been using them
for several years now not just because
they're good humans that care about the
earth but because they have the best
platform for making beautiful websites
quickly and efficiently to demonstrate
how efficient it is to use all the drag
and drop tools I recreated the team
trees website from scratch as you can
see I can delete or select and resize or
drag any element on the page and then
you could always preview to see how
things would look to a visitor on your
site I'm using the Wix payment feature
here which is also super user friendly
to set up there are plenty of other
built-in options as well like putting a
social feed on your site and if you want
to get real fancy corvid by Wix lets you
create super customized elements think
of all the trees you could save if you
just tell people to visit your website
instead of printing out paper brochures

[Music]
So here's a trick to show up to the last picnic of the summer time like a boss.
And all you're gonna need is a watermelon, a coat hanger, and a drill.
(Drill sounds)
So the first thing you'll wanna do is cut a hole in the side of the watermelon,
about the size of a dime, and then take a clean coat hanger
and sort of bend it and shape it and cut it into a size sort of like this.
And then stick it in the end of a drill.
And uhh, really fast, like this.
And then you got yourself a little bit of a blender.
(Drill sounds)
And it really only takes about 30 seconds to just totally liquify the thing.
(Drill sounds)
And then you can take a cup and cut the bottom off like this.
And then sort of reshape the opening so it will host the cup a little better, and you've got a little pouring spout!
And if you wanna go into pro mode, you can draw a face or cut it out on the side.
And there you go. Pours right out. You got yourself a watermelon smoothie with no mess.
And if you want to go into like, super advanced mode, you cut a little flat spot on the bottom, and then it'll stay there itself.
But if you chill the watermelon, it's especially good on a hot day.
And everybody loves it. You're the hero of the picnic.
(Happy music plays)
All that in under two minutes.
It's delicious. Organic, refreshing, little bit creepy.
(Happy music plays)
(Intense DUHH! sound effect plays)
New videos every month! (usually)
"What are you looking at?!"
"I'm looking at you."
"don't look at me."
"I'm looking at you!"
"AHHHHHH!!"
so this isn't school is using two iPad
to to see through body but here at work
when things are kind of intense you
wanted to take a break I want to put a
dartboard in my office but I wasn't sure
ocean would be down with sharp pointy
projectiles and those safety diver
boards totally lame so came up with a
simple solution step one
erase anything of actual importance on
your whiteboard and draw a dark board on
it it's important that it's magnetic to
and then step two you just need some of
these magnetic silver balls I'm using
neo balls and you throw it at it they
actually stick really really well
if you throw it super hard you hit in
the back up top throw a bunch at once
it's using the rare earth magnet so they
stick really well you just might want to
wait though till your boss leaves the
office
do my mama doors better than that and
she's got an alarm did you want to see
more videos like this be sure to
subscribe + then you'll be able to hear
about my Halloween costume idea for next
year which is way cheaper and even more
original to last year's stupid iPad idea
for rich people
you
this bowling ball can get you a strike
every time because after you Bowl it you
simply lean in the direction you want
the ball to turn this idea has been on
my bucket list for over three years so
today I'm gonna tell you how we made it
how exactly it works and what happens
when you take it bowling but neglect to
tell the people you're bowling with
about your slide advantage so this trick
ball looks and feels like a normal
bowling ball and that's because it's
made from a real bowling ball step one
on this project was to harness my inner
Lincoln and Dan to see what's inside an
actual bowling ball the first thing we
discovered is that they aren't symmetric
that means the center of mass isn't at
the actual center point of the ball I
won't get into the physics here but this
is one factor that helps the pros curve
the ball as much as they do next I had
my buddy mark who owns a machine shop
all about the ball using a lathe once
that was done we were left with two
shells and now I just need you to fill
it with some engineering magic and to do
that I need to get myself to London with
the trusty a four second travel montage
[Music]
and the reason I need to get to London
was because this is James Burton and
this is his house well you should know
about James aside from the fact that
he's a mechanical electrical engineer
genius it used to be a toy designer and
I have so much respect for toy designers
because they have to come up with really
clever designs like this guy here where
you could see all of this action powered
by a single spring so it can remain
inexpensive and his super clever designs
include this robot you could control
using this puppet robot or this
real-life Iron Man or Hulkbuster suit or
a bunch of really cool baby aches I had
a basic idea for the mechanism in the
ball and I knew I wanted the guts to be
sort of like a bb-8 so I reached out to
him and in the spirit of full disclosure
it was his expertise that really made
this whole thing possible so if you
enjoy seeing awesome stuff like this you
really need to go check out his videos
and subscribe to his channel
and so after geeking out in his house
for way longer than we should have we
put the ball together and headed to a
proper British bowling alley for the
first official test we started to pretty
low speeds just to prove we had things
basically correct then we started
getting fancy and eventually worked up
to hitting some pin
and as a cool feeling and the reason I
could control the ball by leaning is
because I have this little board taped
to my back that has an inertial
measurement unit on it that can sense
the orientation so if I lean left it
sends that command back to the ball
using radio waves and then the ball has
a receiver that gets the signal to turn
left and then this Arduino which is the
brains of the operation tells a servo
motor how much to rotate which then
rotates this heavy pendulum to the left
and that radically alters the center of
gravity and it starts turning that way
in response just like if you want to
turn on a bike you adjust your center of
gravity by leaning into the turn and if
I want to bowl or ball I can just click
this limit switch and it will ignore all
inputs but as soon as I click it again
then it will once again steer whichever
way I lean and at first we weren't
really getting strikes but that's
because my technique was wrong
hitting the pins dead straight on will
tend to leave the corner pins like this
to get a perfect strike the ball needs
to approach the pins somewhere between
three and six degrees from this point
and that's because at that angle the
ball hits this first pin and the normal
force vector takes out all of these pins
in the line and then the ball contacts
this next pin here and it takes out all
of these pins in a line and then the
balls momentum takes out the final three
Professional Bowlers get their ball
teeth the pins at this side angle by
curving the ball and you kind of have to
do that because if you suck at bowling
like me and you can only Bowl the ball
straight if you extend that straight
line out you would need to pull from the
other Lane over but technically that's
not allowed and so at that point your
mini strategies are either bad CGI or
mechanical engineering and we chose the
latter once I got the angle right we
started blocking in the stripes
in addition to testing our ball we got
to see the machine they used to oil the
lanes and the crazy fascinating machine
that clears and resets the pin after
every frame but that's a topic for
another video and so with everything
working perfectly it was time for the
final test to see how performed in real
life so we arranged to meet some of our
family friends at the local bowling
alley and at first I tried bowling
normally with the controls turned off
but it turns out without the aid of
mechanical engineering I suck at bowling
and nobody likes me so to get my street
cred back I put the switch on and
explained I actually had Jedi powers and
then I use said Jedi powers to steer the
ball get some strikes and reclaim my
edges
[Music]
and it didn't take them long to catch on
to the secret that rolling strikes was
just directly proportional to how much
you leaned
[Music]
[Applause]
when people first look at me they'll
typically make a snap judgment and think
fashion icon and I get it but much like
a transformer there's more than meets
the eye for example right now I am
secretly listening to some dope jams
even though I'm not wearing any
headphones because these aren't normal
sunglasses these are the Botes frames
and they sent them to me to try out for
the past few months and you should know
they supported this video but they
didn't give me any specific talking
points to say beside you just tell
people what you honestly think so this
is my dope tech review by far the
craziest thing about these is the
sensation of hearing really clear audio
without anything on or in your ears when
you experience it for the first time it
just makes you smile if you get the
chance trust me that you really just
need to try it out for yourself these
are sunglasses so they're obviously
designed for situations where you're
outdoors like a park or just walking
around the key is that you can hear your
music but you don't have anything
directly in or on your ears so you have
greater spatial awareness of what's
going on around you and when you wear
these and walk around you just feel like
your life is a cool montage but what's
really clever is that the people right
next to you can't really hear them at
all since it connects via bluetooth as
you would expect you can control your
music directly from the glasses as well
as take calls or use Google assistant or
Siri they've got two primary styles with
Alto and Rondo and they just recently
released a slightly smaller version of
Alto which is probably my favorite the
lenses are also easily interchangeable
if you want to customize it to your
style then these aren't going to replace
my 700s especially when traveling but
they're innovative and they work super
well in the situations they're designed
for which is why they got really
positive reviews from all the actual
tech reviewers so thanks to Bose for
making a great product and thanks to you
for watching
[Music]
two one
this is me reclaiming my title for the
world's largest
and tallest elephant toothpaste
experiment and this
is a totally different kind of reaction
we discovered in all our experimentation
called devil's toothpaste which is
insanely reactive
and super dangerous i'll explain why in
a minute but for now
here's a hint
[Music]
wow and if you look closely in bull
shots i'm not holding the trigger
this kid is in fact that kid was the
whole reason we were there at all
because this was a culmination of
eight months of planning to throw him
the most epic birthday party
ever and all of this started
inadvertently from a single
surprise phone call
what's up flusher
oh my god
what's going on buddy
how are things man they just got better
this is fletcher and this is also
fletcher a year before this call
but unbeknownst to everyone at the time
also pictured here
under all that amazing hair was a
fast-growing brain tumor they eventually
realized something was wrong and
discovered it was a dangerous form of
brain cancer
so rare he was only the sixth kid ever
known to have had it so his family
uprooted their lives for a year and
moved almost a thousand miles to be
closer to saint jude where they removed
the tumor and would try and fix his
brain
in fact our call was the night before he
was going back in
for another brutal week of chemo he's
such a funny kid and i was so inspired
by his hopeful attitude that after
talking for an hour i secretly vowed
that if he made it to 13 years old i
would fly him and his family out and
surprise him
with just the dopest birthday party ever
and not long after i texted fletcher
this picture
so he knew we had closely matching
hairstyles but what he didn't know
is that plans were already underway for
him and i to take back the record for
the world's largest elephant toothpaste
and as a quick refresher
last summer my buddy science bob and i
set the world record for elephant
toothpaste by filling up
an empty swimming pool i wanted to be
able to swim in the foam afterwards so
we figured out how to use yeast as the
catalyst which is in fact
safer but it doesn't react very fast and
our video
seemed to inspire some folks because two
months later this happened in david
dobrik's backyard where they didn't
bother at the yeast
and just took the normal reaction and
scaled it up a bunch but then a few
weeks later these guys in brazil did the
largest experiment yet
and they are the current guinness world
record holders and so even though
fletcher's birthday was still eight
months out
we started our testing right away
because i knew blasting a world record
amount of foam
straight up into the sky wasn't as easy
as it might sound
and the part that could serve me the
most was picking the right nozzle size
and here's what i mean
these three containers are identical
except for the diameter
of their outlets if that diameter is too
large it looks kind of cool
but it doesn't really go that high too
small
and it will go high but it just looks
like confetti
and doesn't look that impressive but for
every container there is a goldilocks
size diameter opening
that gives you that cool laminator
looking flow while still going pretty
high
and you might think well why don't you
just take a typical flask that works so
well
and just scale all the dimensions up and
we tried that on our first
five foot scale test
and just as i feared it went all
confetti on us and the problem is
illustrated here
if you want to scale up and double all
the dimensions of the block
you get this as perfect all these
dimensions increased
exactly by a factor of 2. but wait a sec
the volume increase
by a factor of eight this is called the
squared cube law and its effects are
everywhere in nature such as putting a
hard limit on just how big land animals
can be
because how heavy you are is a function
of your volume
but the strength of your muscles and
bones is a function of their
cross-sectional area so since animals
evolved to get heavier by the power of
three
but stronger by only the power of two at
some point
it's just too much so on the next
five-foot test we increased the top
diameter by a mere three and a half
inches
but now the pendulum swung too far the
other way because while the column looks
smooth
it didn't really go that high and so
finally for the third test we let the
pendulum swing back just a tad
and shave down that diameter by just
over an inch to try and dial in that
goldilocks outlet size
and sure enough the column went really
high and looked
great but this test uncovered another
issue with such a high volume of foam
the pressure was creating some really
high forces in the flask
i mean that's a lot of damage which
quite frankly
left us with only one option
and so with the power flex tape we
scaled things up even further to a 10
foot test
and did our best to interpolate that
goldilocks outlet
size
[Applause]
so once again the outlet size worked
great but our joint construction wasn't
prepared
for the further scaled up forces in fact
scory fat
w for the flex tape where you could see
it single-handedly held the thing
together even as the screws and wood
busted through and we were realizing we
just had to make the structure so over
engineered and indestructible so the
only option for the foam to escape the
high pressure
would be going out the top and so while
that wasn't a perfect result i felt like
we'd learned enough from all of our
failures to design it strong enough
for the final 20 foot world record
version in the end we ran
over 150 tests not only to determine the
right scaled up flask dimensions
but things like does neck length have an
effect what happens if you vary the soap
amounts what effect do different brands
of food coloring have
all of these tests were really
insightful but perhaps the most
interesting finding was stumbling upon
something i've affectionately named
devil's toothpaste now you might be
thinking devil's toothpaste
that seems a bit extreme mark but allow
me to demonstrate this is a shoebox full
of the standard formula of hydrogen
peroxide sodium iodide and soap
that pretty much everyone uses to make
elephant toothpaste now here's the same
volume of reactants
only this time using devil's toothpaste
now see if you can spot the difference
in real time
not only is it hyper-reactive but the
reaction is much hotter so you get these
really cool bubble formations
here's one more once again this is
normal elephant's toothpaste in an
erlenmeyer flask no big deal
people have been doing this for years
but once again here's the same volume of
reactants
now only with devil's toothpaste
given how explosive this is this may be
irresponsible of me but while we watch
the replay i'll tell you exactly how to
make it you start with 2016
once that mixes you're gonna
throw winfrey torch on the leftover
rabbit fur
and you're good to go and so by taking
some rigorous safety precautions
we also intended to set the first and
therefore only world record
for the world's largest devil's
toothpaste experiment by filling six
55-gallon drums with 400 times the
amount that broke the flask here and so
after 150 tests and eight months of work
feeling much more confident about our
build plans and chemistry we packed
everything up and made our way
to the small farming town of gridley
california we chose gridley because our
family friend dale graciously agreed to
let us use his land which is full of
hundreds of acres of walnut trees
now don't even think about it fat gus he
also had a great backyard we could make
use of
and so with only four days left till
fletcher was flying out for the party
we got to work on a 20-second build
[Music]
montage
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
and it took four consecutive 14-hour
back-breaking days of labor in the hot
sun
because with so much time to plan the
most epic birthday party ever i just
kept adding more and more ideas to the
list we would need to pull off so in
addition to building the indestructible
20-foot flask and the devil's toothpaste
dumping mechanism we also needed to make
a methane bubble fountain a 3d bubble
printer
a fire tornado a slip n slide into a
pool and
an epic bubble pit and even though i
brought my buddies it was cool to see
this turn into a modern day small town
usa barn racing if we needed extra hands
or a piece of equipment
10 neighbors were there like instantly
to help us out and so the morning of the
big day there was still a lot of last
minute scrambling but things were
looking pretty good i'm seriously so
nervous right now i love
pranks and a surprise is like the most
wholesome type of prank so
i haven't been able to sleep for days
just thinking about this like every last
detail to how this will go down
and so with only one hour left we did
one final test run on everything
first the devil's toothpaste
a perfecto and then the 20-foot flask
for the real reaction the peroxide would
fill the whole bottom pool where john
was standing and then the troughs would
dump over all the catalyst at once sort
of like this
and i should mention guinness only lets
you choose one world record category per
vent
so we were going for the tallest but
when we did the math to scale up the
flaster the arbitrary height i picked of
20 feet and this is a true story
it was exactly one gallon less than the
folks in brazil who set the world record
for the largest
and so don't mind me while i set these
two gallon containers right here and so
as people started gathering for the
surprise i hit the hardened streets of
gridley california
to look for some kind of last-minute
disguise
[Music]
and so after a bit of a warm-up because
these are all moves i can for sure do
and that's definitely me in the costume
the moment i had spent the last eight
months planning for had finally arrived
and the cover story for the kids is they
were coming to tour a walnut farm of a
distant relative
[Applause]
and to provide a good juxtaposition i
wanted him to feel as awkward as
possible for this part
and then when we gathered for the
picture i snuck up right behind him
and took off my mask all right
cool what do you guys want to do next
what should we do
his sister isla also had no idea any of
this was going to happen
what up buddy how are you get in here
i'm the boy
what's up dude
[Music]
when i'm not making videos i'm the
gridly mascot
mascot to really stretch out the
surprise i wanted to think i was only
there to drop in and say hi
so i had dale suggest that i take the
kids for a ride in his dune buggy to
which i reluctantly agreed because you
know
i'm a busy guy i could do it like 15
minutes you guys want to go for a razor
ride
is that cool let's get the whole crew
your sister i had about like a half an
hour so
it's good to meet you in real life
[Music]
a single walnut grows in one of these
which is crazy to me
all of those are just a single walnut
as we pulled up the driveway i stopped
the dune buggy in a precisely
predetermined location where the view of
the 20-foot flask was obscured by the
truck i heard it was your birthday so i
got you something simple well tomorrow's
my real day oh yeah tomorrow i'm one day
off
so fletch i've gotta uh i gotta come
clean buddy
you and i today are gonna set a guinness
world record
for the world's tallest elephant
toothpaste wait what
are you kidding me you are currently in
a youtube video
i want you to wave your 20 million of
your newest friends hello
we're gonna put all the elephant
toothpaste in there and just blast it in
the air yeah i got six minutes
i actually fully cleared my schedule
with the surprise fully and successfully
executed
my heart rate finally lowered a bit and
i gave them a preview of all the cool
stuff we had lined up for the party then
we headed to the backyard where he saw
the setup
and his mom you are devious
because at this point it did sunk in
that there would be no walnut farm tour
and that her and i had been conspiring
for months
[Music]
for now though it was time to party
my
and everybody starts to move
[Music]
oh
[Music]
hey
before we busted out the flaming bubbles
or the bubble pit we headed across the
street to check out the world's first
and therefore largest devil's toothpaste
experiment
three
[Music]
oh my god
science bob came over and hooked us up
with the slow-mo shot
[Music]
hmm
this shot was from a gopro on rails and
we weren't quite fast enough with the
pole and for some reason i found this
like
wall-e level pathetically sad you can
see even in slo-mo
the reaction happened so incredibly fast
and i apologize for the gratuitous
amount of slow-mo but this has got to be
the coolest thing i've ever filmed
[Music]
and afterwards it kept oozing this
rainbow play-doh extrusion thing
[Music]
it just looked like some kind of
whimsical alien landscape
and as you can see over time it just
sort of deflates itself
and after that we went back and ate some
dinner and had some amazing and not at
all creepy army of fletcher face
cupcakes
while the crew started prepping for the
big world record finale in the vein of
cool stuff i would need to have at my
birthday party if i was turning 13 years
old i of course had to bust out the elon
musk flamethrower to light some fire
bubbles and finally was back to the
front yard to top things off with the
most amazing bubble pit ever
it was like belly flopping on a cloud
[Music]
and at this point we realized it was
taking way longer to fill up than we had
calculated so it was all hands on deck
to try and pull this off
before the sun went down oh and this is
cool the bubble pit was dual purpose
because once emptied it served as the
bunker to give a completely safe front
row seat
to whatever was about to happen and so
with the flask really close to being
filled
fletcher asked to take a very quick
last-minute ride in the tesla because
he'd never been in one
side this is in like every
video you guys are in a mark grover
video for the request
i gave them a quick ride
remember our story all right 10 miles an
hour tops
and so with the official measurement
drone in the air our timing was perfect
because we made it back just as they
were sealing up the door for the big
moment okay fletcher
i'm handing this to you officially to
think you should have been touring a
walnut farm right now
and so after eight months of planning
and so much work by so many people
the coolest birthday present i've ever
given anybody
came down to this moment here we go
three
two one
[Applause]
it worked it went
[Applause]
look at my truck let's go oh my god
what do you guys think
the bottom look at the truck it's like
buried next to it
[Music]
and i'd just like to point out how great
that flowing column looks with a
perfectly selected outlet diameter that
is
until things got chaotic once the
pressure changed drastically from the
big rupture
we literally made a rocket ship i mean
fundamentally
this is how rockets propel themselves an
actual failure mode wasn't really a
floor strength issue as much as it was a
stiffness issue
i knew our structure weighed over a ton
so i just didn't consider that the
reaction could lift the whole thing
five feet into the freaking air and in
nasa that's what we refer to as a
critical oversight but honestly this
result was way more spectacular plus it
leaves room for improvement and i should
also
note even with all that we still crushed
the previous world record
by more than double and so as the sun
went down science bob lit up the fire
tornado as a fitting end to the party
[Music]
[Applause]
i also told fletcher there was one more
thing which is that with a little help
from dale he could use some heavy
equipment
to destroy our beautiful creation
[Music]
and so with that the party was all over
[Music]
i'll never forget this oh as they drove
away i thought about everything they've
been through for the past year
and all the people that came together
from all across the country
to donate their time and energy for a
kid they've never even met
and i might not vote the exact same as
all of them
but for like five inspiring days none of
that stuff mattered
whenever i find myself short on hope i
find it helps to put my phone down
and choose to see the good parts in my
fellow humans and be
one of the good parts for my fellow
humans to see and so to fletcher
thank you for being such a good example
of holding onto hope
amidst really lame circumstances happy
birthday buddy
and congrats on your new world record
in the end we used a chemical reaction
to basically make a rocket ship now if
you want the same
experience only without the eight months
of prep work you're in luck
[Laughter]
it should come as no surprise that this
cool rocket kit comes from
my friends at kiwico this is the most
expensive video i ever made
by a very comfortable margin and you
should know it wouldn't have been
possible
without their support and they're the
best because they deliver these really
cool monthly crates that help kids see
themselves as engineers and creative
innovators all while managing to be
super fun at the same time
now come with these really simple
kid-friendly instructions plus all the
supplies you'll need to put it together
so you know you won't have to make a run
to the store
each one also includes a custom booklet
that teaches you practical science and
gives you even more experiments you
could try with just stuff you got lying
around your house
and there's something for everyone
because they've got eight different
crate lines for all different ages that
cover the full steam spectrum from
science and engineering to art and
design
so if you want to support my channel and
get your brain back in shape for school
in a way that doesn't involve a screen
you can go to kiwico.commarkrover or use
the link in the video description
to get your first box free and this also
really does make for a great gift for
any young person in your life so thanks
to kiwico for being the best
thanks to everyone who just made this
the most epic birthday party ever
and thanks to you for watching
if we can wrap up here then we'll be
able to go back
it's mr beast what's up jimmy
yeah i'm filming it depends
yeah why are you asking me so many
questions about elephant toothpaste
this is the brand new Guinness World
Record largest ever elephant toothpaste
comb experiment in today's video which
is partially sponsored by LastPass I'm
gonna walk you through everything we
have to go through to get to this point
as well as some really cool side
discoveries who made in our hundreds of
hours of testing along the way the main
ingredient for elephant's toothpaste is
hydrogen peroxide it's the same stuff
you pour on it's great to disinfect it
the thing is the bonds the hold the
hydrogen and oxygen together are pretty
weak so if we poured some of this in
here and just left it for a while it
would keep releasing oxygen and
eventually you'd be left with just water
however if you add a catalyst like
potassium iodide you could make that
slow process happen almost instantly so
that's cool but we can make it way more
impressive if we had one key ingredient
so so if we pour this in and then do
everything else the same now when the
oxygen is released the soap captures it
creating bubbles and foam and then
finally if you all that again only now
you add food coloring and use the flask
that tapers like this you can focus the
expansion of foam so it looks maximum
awesome
[Music]
so in order to fill a pool with this
stuff I first got together with some
friends and we spent literally hundreds
of hours for a few weeks running
experiments to calculate the best raw
ingredient combinations in addition to
brainstorming other cool things we might
do with it and so before we attempted to
shatter the current world record we had
an end-of-summer party with my son and a
bunch of family friends where we wanted
to share with them the coolest side
discoveries from our research but first
in true end-of-summer fashion we had to
knock out some slip-and-slide cake bomb
I plan to kick things off by attacking
them with an elephant toothpaste gun we
made as revenge for when a bunch of
these same kids ambushed me on a recent
beach trip and then offer me some
cookies which were just six massive
cockroaches and I hate cockroaches
however as part of our testing we
discovered the reaction is highly
exothermic which means it generates heat
as a by-product if you watch it infrared
you'll see the temperature of the foam
right after the reaction can reach
almost 200 degrees Fahrenheit so because
I'm nice I shall - my revenge plans and
just demonstrated what would have been
their fates and told them to sit and
watch at a safe distance and they
listened sort of and so now that we have
their attention it was Showtime
[Music]
this one is called the melted unicorn
[Music]
you might recognize Bob flute Felder
here aka science Bob he's been on Jimmy
Kimmel Live 11 more times than I have
and I invited him out to join me for a
very specific reason which I will
address in a bit
[Music]
and so with the success of the science
show behind us it was now time for Phase
two so we are here standing in an empty
swimming pool about to try and break the
world record for elephant's toothpaste
you want to tell the good people who
owns the current world record Bob idea
you want tell the good people who's
about to not own the world record Bob -
aren't ya but if everything goes well
we're hoping to quadruple the amount of
the current record which you hold I'm
not sure how much of like the trees the
neighborhood we're gonna cover in the
process only time will tell
and chemistry which I don't understand
but who all's thing oh you come up with
[Music]
we wanted the phone to be safe to play
in afterwards so we used ordinary baking
yeast as our catalyst we could have
bought yeast in big buckets but it
turned out it was cheaper to get them in
one-pound bags the only downside to that
is then you have to cut open a hundred
and eighty one pound bags at least but
that's why we have sides Bob come on up
they said it'll be fun they said
[Music]
this is an emergency tarp system so if
we did on that right it shouldn't
overflow in the case that it does give
these types here to contain all of the
foam not going everywhere in the yards
we hope for the best plan for the worst
[Applause]
we built these three frames for the
tarps that would contain the catalyst
ease solution so when it was time to
fill the pool we could just cut the
tarps and it would pour out the same way
we cut the tarp when we added the bigger
Orbeez and Kevin let's go time baby
probably like seven minutes out got a
bunch of kids inside or just raring to
get out the challenge here is this water
is warm we didn't build these containers
big enough so this will start rising but
it's sort of a race against the clock
the port starts overflowing we still
have to add this soap
[Music]
this looks terrifying as I stab this
bloody thing think I'm about to get
demonetised this is what will actually
make the bubbles soap isn't part of the
reaction so after a few final touches we
were ready to go then before we got the
tarps I want to point out I'm not a
chemist with the physics and engineering
problem I'm Way more comfortable
understanding the parameters and getting
closer to the final solution off the bat
but chemistry is just little molecules I
can't see and it feels a lot like trial
and error without any guarantee it will
actually scale up predictably this was
feeling like the nightmare of the jello
pool all over again to get to this point
we had ran over 150 tests sometimes at
great peril to that which we hold dear
and so once again if this was a total
failure it wouldn't be from lack of
effort having said all that he or she is
to one go
[Music]
so the good news is we broke the record
the bad news is we're kind of
overachievers oh it's coming up the
great tsunami and hold this okay stand
back off the tart oh we need to grab
them stand back
pull this up Bob okay
[Music]
so we pushed all the foam back into the
pool that gave it some time to cool down
so we could actually touch it
[Music]
the drone was super cool because not
only did it make the foam look like an
alien cocoon but you could see it travel
in infrared because it would expose the
much hotter lower layers of foam as it
flew around
[Music]
after all our tests we perfected the
chemistry for this stuff so if you want
to make a home version you can play with
check out science Bob's website I'll

all right Bob sorry you're looking at an
obsolete piece of material there I had
it for over a year you did have it
forever here but all good things must
come to an end Matt but sorry that was a
lot of fun that was a lot of fun and I
have good news because you are still the
world-record holder I'm putting you on
there with me buddy I am
so much of our lives today revolve
around apps and websites that require
secure passwords that's why for seven
years I've been using LastPass we also
happen to be sponsoring this portion of
the video I've been a massive fan of
what they do for so long because they
free your brain from the burden of
remembering all of your passwords so you
no longer need to store them at using
low-tech methods or worse yet in your
own memory
we're example desktop and mobile for
both iOS and Android and it's integrated
into your phone so it comes right up for
any website or app and it will
automatically fill up with your username
and password with no type and required
and you get unlimited password storage
and it syncs for free across all of your
devices plus it's super secure because
your data is encrypted and decrypted at
the device level so even LastPass
doesn't actually know what any of your
passwords are so if you're finally ready
to give your brain a break remembering

Why do horns and musical instruments have this flared shape. To answer this question about a year ago
I decided I would take this and scale it up to this
But I've never actually made something this big for my channel before so as usual we decided to make a smaller prototype
Model to see what we could learn about the challenges that would come from scaling it all the way up
So we started by creating a plaster mold with the right curvature
then you cover that with a gel coat and then we put three layers of fiberglass and
Polyester resin and then when you pop it out of the mold, you're left with this
We're immediately struck that there is in fact something really special about this shape
So I'm going to switch over from my lav mic to my shotgun mic for this demo
Here's my voice normal.
here's my voice while using the tube
which shows there's more going on here than just focusing the sound in one direction
Here's my voice using the horn
You can even hear me whisper... which is creepy
So this was proof that the curved shape of the horn had a significant effect on amplifying the input sound
But I still wasn't sure why, so now it's time to really scale things up to the big monster horn
Which we did by applying all the same principles
We learned on the prototype and then we headed to the most desolate location we could find on Google Maps to put it together
[Some cool music]
Mark's assistant: "Can you hear me"
Mark's assistant: "Hello over there!"
Mark: "It feels like you're like right on my shoulder"
As you know, the base of the horn is what's responsible for creating all the sound so to see what's inside
I thought it was only appropriate to open it with my friends Dan and Lincoln from the popular YouTube channel
What's Inside. And it turns out it's pretty simple: the key is this thin metal circular plate or diaphragm.
So the air comes in here at 100 psi and passes around this diaphragm in such a way that it causes it to vibrate
110 times in a second which causes a corresponding pressure wave to shoot out here and down the throat of the horn
So after a few hours, everything was finally set up and it was the moment of truth since after 8 months
None of us had actually ever heard it fire yet and Lincoln hadn't even seen the thing because we made him wait in the car
Mark: "This is the big reveal"
Mark: "You Ready?"
One two, here it is
[high pitched air horn]
Isn't that pretty loud?
Lincoln: "Wow, that's so cool!"
This actually isnt it, its that. The idea, now you can learn
[Lincoln:] Oh my!
Before we fire it
We need to first talk about how hearing works and what I eventually learned about why horns have that curved shape
Let's say this jello block represents a volume of air molecules if that horn diaphragm hits the jello molecules over here
There's a chain reaction of jello molecules crashing into each other
Until finally you see movement on the other side of the jello block and this is where your eardrum is
So it moves back and forth at the same rate as the horn diaphragm because of all of these
collisions of the jello
molecules in between
this is called a pressure wave and it's how sound travels through air and so if the horn diaphragm is hitting the air molecules at
A high frequency or very frequently our brain decodes that as a high pitch
But if the crashes are happening at a low frequency or less frequently than our brain decodes that as a low pitch. Okay
But why the curvy horn shape? Well that has to do with something called impedance matching
Basically, the horn diaphragm is very solid and strong and it pushes against the air which doesn't offer much resistance
It's not very effective like trying to break a piece of paper by punching it
So without the curvy horn portion as the diaphragm moves back and forth
It interfaces with the air sort of like this. You can still see the jello is moving on the opposite side
Just not that much because the air is just too thin and weak over this small of an area
So to have a better interface with the air you put a big curvy shape right after the diaphragm
You can see now your eardrum is moving back and forth much more vigorously because the interface is so much better
so the sounds louder with a curved horn not because you're amplifying the sound but because you're conserving the sound this makes sense because
Amplifying means you're adding power to the system and there's no battery or  plugs at the curve section of a horn
It's passive
So by impedance matching you give yourself a much larger area to push against all the air at the outlet which makes for a more
effective chain reaction of molecules crashing into your eardrum
And now the horn
Isn't that pretty loud?
Lincoln: "Wow, that's so cool!"
Is that pretty good?
This actually isnt it, its that. The idea, now you can learn
[LOUD Horn sound]
[laughter]
Oh my gosh
Just like eight months of work
That's the first time we've actually fired off and that's behind the horn
Dan: I could feel the vibrations
Yeah
[?] be in front of that thing
We're gonna go see what it's like on the other side. All right
So this is we're about two football fields away from the horn. We have no idea how loud this is gonna sound here
All right Ken, fire the normal air horn
(Air horn firing)
Yeah, we could hear it now we're a little nervous cuz you can hear it decently well
Alright, firing
[BIG horn firing]
[laughs]
So for our second test we drove about a mile(1.6 Km) away and you can barely see the horn right here
Alright, Ken fire.
[Air horn firing]
Lincoln: We can still completley hear it, that's crazy
You can hardly see that massive horn, but it's still super loud. So let's just drive keep going
We're gonna go real far
So from satellite view
This is where the horn was
Here was the first spot and then the second spot and then here was the third spot two and a half miles[4 Km] away
Okay, so the horn is now super far away. I literally can't see with my naked eye.
Dan: It's so far away
Dan: I can barely see it. It's right at the crest of the hill. There's a little tiny speck and it's right there
We're gonna do an experiment and we're gonna test the speed of sound
We should hear it on this walkie-talkie and then some amount of time later
We might be able to hear it from this distance
Lincoln's gonna measure the time on his stopwatch and then we should be able to calculate from there what the speed of sound is
We're ready when you ar
bwowwwwwwwwwww
[temporary silence ]
Mark:Wait for it
Vmmmmmmmm
That's crazy! How long. It took 11 seconds
for the sound of the horn to get here
It's so clear. Like I feel like we can go 10 miles further
Think about what this means?
It took an unbroken chain of two and a half miles of air molecules 11 seconds to all collide with each other
Until they made it all the way down here and bumped into the air molecules in our ear canals which then bumped into our eardrums
Hi!
Wait, what if I scream?
[Screams]
So the Sun was quickly going down
But before we went home
We wanted to try and break some glass and if you want to break glass with what is essentially little puffs of air the trick
Is to find out its resonant frequency. You actually know all about this
If you've ever used one of these I can make Eliza go really high
With just a little force now if I apply that force at random intervals, it doesn't do very much. It's not fun, huh?
No, it's not fun
But if I apply that force equal to the timing of the natural frequency of the swing those little pushes add to each other
Go higher Mark Rober
And so in this case the resonant frequency increased our fun, but if engineers don't take this into consideration
It could lead to disaster such as when wind gusts going at just the right rate destroy the Tacoma Narrows Bridge
It's also why soldiers don't march in unison when crossing a bridge
So if you measure the natural frequency of the glass with an accelerometer like this
Then you just need to make sure your horn fires at that exact frequency or a multiple there of
Or you can just change the natural frequency of the glass to match your horn by adding weights in the right spot
[Glass break]
Shoutout to Lincoln and Dan from What's Inside for helping me out. We actually investigated
What's inside an old Japanese air-raid siren for their video?
It's a totally different way to make a really loud sound
So you should go check that out using the link in the description
This horn is easily the largest thing I've ever built for my channel and it took eight months of coordination with my former NASA
buddy Ken to pull it off
The problem is that Ken lives way down here by NASA but I live 400 miles up this way
So I partnered with Portal from Facebook to better collaborate on the design and build process
So he put a portal in his workshop and I set up a portal plus in mine and besides the high fidelity audio
And the HD video. I think the coolest thing about portal is the smart camera feature, which you see in action here
So as I would move around my workshop and Ken moved around his the camera frames the video to keep us both centered and this
Is great for us because we're not
constantly moving the cameras around or tied to just working in one spot and smart sound enhances our voices as we move about so we
Can still hear each other regardless of other shop noise
[Diaphragm drop off]
[Laugh]
And of course when it comes to any device in a home, privacy is a big deal
So with a single tap portal will allow you to disconnect both the camera and the microphone or if you prefer an analog solution
They provide a camera cover
Also, the smart camera uses AI technology that runs locally on portal not on some remote servers.
At the end of the day, it's a great piece of hardware and it worked really well for us
So if you want to learn more about Portal or maybe even get your own just go ahead and use the link in the video description.

This is the world's first ever actual pool of Jello!
And while it may look simple, it's actually a very difficult engineering challenge to pull off.
As proof, if you Google "Jello Pool," you will either find bad CGI,
or a handful of videos of people who tried to do this, but it really didn't work out.
So today, we are going to answer possibly the longest standing question from my childhood:
What would it be like to actually belly flop in a pool of Jello?
But before we do that, I want to talk about what we
actually had to go through for the past 6 months to pull this off.
The idea of a Jello pool has been on my bucket list for over 4 years.
In fact, when Kevin from The Backyard Scientist and I made the 25 million Orbeez pool,
our first idea was to do a pool of Jello, but it's really hard.
Because if you've ever made Jello, you might recall
you first have to boil water, then mix in the powder,
and then you have to refrigerate it for it to actually get firm.
And that's easy enough to do for a small dish
but how do you boil and then refrigerate an entire pool?
This seemed like a very worthy engineering challenge.
So year at Thanksgiving, my brother and I came up with a plan
and then in the middle of winter, we started digging a hole in his backyard.
Then over the course of 2 months we set up a bunch of small-scale experiments
because we needed to answer questions like:
How much gelatin powder does it actually take to get to the ideal firmness?
And how hot, and then cold, does the mixture actually need to get
for the Jello chemical reaction to take place so it will actually get firm
From our experiments, we learned that the Jello always got firm as long as
the mixture got hotter than 160° Fahrenheit.
So we decided we could scale this up by using
6, 55 gallon drums with a custom propane burner underneath
and a spigot we welded to the sides, but more on that later.
So now we knew how we were going to heat it up
but how do you refrigerate an entire pool?
For that, we teamed up with Mother Nature and just picked
the perfect location and time of year.
We installed a thermometer and starting in January
we tracked the temperature in his backyard every night.
We needed refrigerator temperatures at night,
but not freezer temperatures, because that would freeze the jello
and our experiments showed that totally ruins it.
And so after looking at our data, plus historical
temperature plots, we knew we had about
a 3-week sweet spot window towards the end of April to pull this off.
Our goal is to have a Jello pool party
in his backyard, that would make even
Phineas and Ferb jealous.
So the plan was to start 7 days before the party,
and fill the pool with an average of 10 barrels every day.
That would give each layer a chance to get exposed to
the cold night air, to more efficiently get rid of the heat.
And so with that, first thing Saturday, a full week
before the party, [water splash] we got to work
♪ Faidherbe Square - ProleteR ♪
We didn't want to waste actual food, so this was just
water and gelatin powder and food coloring.
But there's no sugar.
♪ Faidherbe Square - ProleteR ♪
We intentionally placed our barrels much higher than
the pool, so when we're ready, we can use
the potential energy to move the Jello from the barrels
to the pool.
We had to tackle about a thousand other issues that
came up, that I won't bore you with, but
day by day, and layer by layer, the pool
began to fill up.
Because the Jello went in with so much heat energy,
we needed to remove before it could get firm,
in addition to using the cold night air, my
brother's neighbor, Nick, happened to have a spare swamp
cooler, in his shop.
So we kept that running over the top of the pool,
pretty much the whole week.
This gave us convection cooling, it's
the equivalent of rolling down a car window
for the pool, or like, when you blow
on the top of a hot cup of soup.
This constantly replaces the evaporating layer of air
right at the surface with fresh, cold air,
that will suck out the heat more efficiently.
And so, as we put in the final batch Friday night
with ominous weather
threatening to ruin the whole effort.
At this point, we had done all we could.
We were exhausted after a week
and I wasn't feeling super confident
because my specialty is more of mechanical things
and this project was more about chemistry and thermodynamics.
And I didn't want that lame "Jelly-Baff" stuff
people trying to pass off as Jello.
And so even if it didn't last long in the Sun,
I wanted to at least have the experience
of seeing even a single belly flop
on a smooth pool of actual Jello.
If this was gonna be a total failure,
it wouldn't be from lack of effort.
And so we woke up Saturday morning,
with a forecast for a warm sunny day
and we pulled off the tarp
to find a pool
filled with actual freaking Jello.
♪ Sappheiro - Falling ft. eSoreni ♪
By this point, word in the neighborhood
had definitely spread around
as to what we were up to.
And my brother asked if some of their friend's kids
could have first dibs.
And so with that, I'm happy to report
this is what it looks like to belly flop
in a pool of Jello.
♪ Sappheiro - Falling ft. eSoreni ♪
Not yet! (Wait, wait Adam)
♪ Pokemon in NYC ft. Missy - Andrew Applepie ♪
When I first got in myself,
it was closer to the middle of the day and one of the things we discovered was that
direct sunlight over time
had the effect of undoing some of the
solidness of the lower layers.
(Laughter)
When you go in it just feels-fills your nose
and like ears. It's a very surreal feeling
I'm just being like. Its kinda hard to move
but its just slimy and slippery
It actually feels really cool
We have some pool toys uhh... hidden underneath
Got it!
Wow!
It's unlike anything I mean it's like swimming in snot.
If that makes any sense?
But like a good snot!
To keep solid for even longer, if we were to do it again
We might put in a heat exchanger pipe system beneath the surface
sort of how like they freeze indoor ice-skating rinks.
And maybe use a little sugar
That's disgusting!
Now at this point you might be thinking 
"Why would anyone spend their
effort of 6 months of planning, and then a solid week of back-breaking effort just to make a stupid pool of Jello?"
And to that I say,
"Why do people go through the effort of climbing Mount Everest?
Why did Neil Armstrong go through the effort of stepping on the moon?
And why did Pam and Jim go through the effort of convincing Dwight, that Jim had always been Asian?"
Dwight: "This is Jim."
Sometimes, you don't do a thing because you should, but simply to prove that you can.
Now that my curiosity was fully satiated and on my ongoing quest to be the favorite uncle,
I told my nephews they can invite some of their friends over
And my brother's family, setup a neighborhood BBQ.
And at this point, after a lot of hours of belly flops,  and bowling balls, and direct sunlight,
The Jello was pretty broken down
But that didn't stop us from setting up
a Jello pool slip-and-slide

And I love their sense of adventure but it was a bit of an "Uncle Fail Moment"
because apparently, none of them have ever used a slip-and-side

We didn't actually put any sugar in here so it's kinda disgusting so, we've got some real-

This was a Bucket List video idea I've had for as long as I can remember
and I wouldn't have been able to pull it off if it wasn't for the support of my friends at "NordVPN"
As I'm sure you know by now, by using a "VPN",
you can search the web anonymously,
you're location stays private
and your data is encrypted
And for my friends in the EU you might have heard recently that article 13 passed.
That means that a lot of the websites you love to use,
will be forced to be far more restricted.
I'm not saying you do this
But hypothetically, if you're using the VPN,
You can virtually teleport and trick the internet to think you're

I was challenged to create electricity to support this beast
It's Volkswagens carbon-fiber dual engine
Faster than a Formula one electric supercar
For the upcoming infamous 12 and 1/2 mile Pikes Peak race to the top of a really high mountain in Colorado
And they gave me no further instructions on how they wanted it done
So I thought how cool to be to charge it up using one of those science fair lemon batteries
And since I'm pretty sure using only one lemon isn't going to cut it
My plan is to build the Guinness world record
World's largest lemon battery and when it comes to making ridiculous things no one is better at that than fellow YouTube engineer
William P. Osman. The first video I saw of yours was when you bio hacked your dog. How did that work?
Not well
we tried to dangle a hot dog in front of a dog's face on a
Mechanical backpack and then you can steer the hot dog
To try to get the dog to change directions and what he ended up doing was sitting down and eating him
So we've estimated this should take about three days for us to build and yet I've only allotted
Two minutes for this in the video. So you know what that means you plan on your videos
We didn't want our battery setup to just be a mangled mess of wires
So William had the brilliant idea to waterjet out a bunch of copper and zinc strips, which we can then assemble into racks
Who are the first half of the racks to be in parallel and that was in series with the second half of the racks
Which were also all in parallel and then at that point all we had to do was impale some lemons
Speaking of which in addition to harvesting from my own backyard
I visited some local farms and got their class two lemons
Which means they couldn't be sold in stores because they were either overripe miss shapen or too small
and when one finds oneself in possession of
1232 lemons, turns out you can't not do this
So here we have the world's largest
Lemon battery and now is the moment of truth to see just how much power this could actually make for us
But in order to understand the results, let's first review how a lemon can even make power in the first place
The trick is picking the right metals to stick into the lemon in this case
Zinc really wants to get rid of electrons and then copper really wants to collect them
But they can't do that unless they're connected by some kind of electrolyte and that's the lemon juice
once that happens an electrochemical reaction occurs the bass and the electrons can now move and moving electrons is the very definition of
Electricity it's sort of like how the water up high in the full cup naturally wants to flow to the empty cup lower down
But it can't do that until you connect the two with the straw which allows the water to flow
So in this case, obviously the higher cup is the zinc
The lower cup is the copper and the straw is the lemon and so then the flowing water
represents our electricity or power and so with that we were measuring just under five volts and the short-circuit current is
Not great, Mark. Basically, our lemon battery is awful. Yeah like it's impressive
No, the fact that it works as well as it does is cool. But as well as it works is not
Well, does that make any sense? It makes no sense whatever you just said
And to quantify the suckiness better you can listen to a motor running off our 1,200 lemons
Versus a single double-a battery
So what was looking good for the car
But we weren't about to let three days of work go down the drain
So because the battery produces so little power we use a tiny tiny
High gear ratio motor fifteen hundred to one to charge up our potential energy
Which is more lemon so it should take about 15 minutes to lift this bag and then we can release that all at once
to activate our lemon juicing mechanism, basically
Like all of these guys are working together to like drain the lifeblood from one of their brethren. Maybe this is too dark
Okay, William moment of truth. I am so excited. Give me some of that. Cheers. Cheers
Wow refreshing
organic not worth
10 hours amazing 12 hours totally worth it
This is the most expensive glass of lemonade you will ever have. Yes, that actually is a fact. It's a win in my book
I'm gonna finish this. I'm not
So we let the lemons trickle charge for a couple days
And after that the total power we harvested for the Volkswagen
Racing team was the equivalent of a single double-a battery and I should mention that since the race team is busy getting the car ready
For the race in Colorado. They have sent me this monstrous 48 kilowatt hour battery that can drive itself
So the plan is I will add any power we generate here in
California to this battery and then get this to them in time for the race in, Colorado
So the measly lemon power is now inside, but clearly I need to think of a plan B
Luckily I had an idea
Which is to take some pulleys and a skateboard wheel and a brushless motor then some custom machined aluminum plates and a steel
Cable to make a zipline with regenerative braking to charge a drill battery
And it seems to actually be working. All I needed now was a party with some family friends and their kids
This is how much energy is in the battery. We need to get it from empty all the way up to the full
That's where I need you guys because what happens is as you go down on this zipline
It charges the battery
The worst part about a zipline is when you have to go down and then drag it back up the hill
But I've got a little remote control here watch this
Is that cool? You guys want to ride that? you ready?
Mechanical advantage of the sloped Hill disguises it well
But the amount of energy they are adding to our zipline system here by running up the hill just one time is the same energy
used for the world record dead lift
And to provide power to their leg muscles
we repurposed our lemon battery lemons into fresh lemonade and
Everyone had to take a drink before running up the hill because as they say when life gives you 1200 lemons make lemonade
Then force kids to drink it to power your regenerative zipline
So the zipline was awesome
And we ended up charging up one of these portable drill batteries plus a little more. Now for those of you keeping track at home
Here's how I'm doing so far
the limits have enough power to move the
supercar about this far on a soccer field and then with the lemonade and the kids muscles in the zipline it can now travel an
additional two soccer fields
The problem is the race is 200 soccer fields long, which means if we were to try and charge the car
We'd be 198 soccer fields short. So clearly that kind of power will not be breaking any records
So I've got to come up with a plan C and to do that
I'm gonna harness the power of the Sun and in hindsight
I probably should have started here because if you think about it all the energy sources we use are actually
solar powered. Oil and coal and natural gas
It's just old decayed plants and swamps that originally got their power from the Sun using their leaves and photosynthesis
Even things like wind turbines are really solar powered because the wind blows when the Sun heats up the atmosphere
unevenly in the case of
hydroelectric dams the water got to the lake on the high side because of rain from the clouds and clouds a result of water that
Has been evaporated by you guessed it, the Sun. As humans
We are even solar power because we get our energy from plants or animals that ate plants
Which again get their power from the Sun
so if I was looking for some energy to fill up a battery instead of indirectly and
Inefficiently going through a bunch of different energy sources and losing a bunch at every step along the way
it makes way more sense to just go directly to the source
And so with that in mind I busted out the power tools and put twenty-four 100 watt solar panels over our garage
But there was a problem with this. When NASA sent the solar power twin Rovers to Mars in 2004
It didn't take long until the solar panels were
Totally covered in dust which effectively crippled the rover because they couldn't get as much energy from the Sun and this was a huge issue
But then we got lucky and a mini tornado came by and cleaned them off restoring the power
It turns out these mini tornadoes are actually pretty common on Mars which is why she is still driving around today
Nearly more than 14 years later. This is also in part why on the next Rover we sent to Mars
We just killed the issue altogether and slapped a nuclear reactor on the back and while California isn't Mars
It does get pretty dusty here. So to ensure that wouldn't happen to me
I invited over some really smart future engineers scientists and creators
and after explaining the problem and
demonstrating how severely it limits the power output from the panel's I challenged them to come up with and build a solution
And because our brains use up 20% of all the energy our body produces. I made them drink more lemonade to ensure
I got an optimal solution and so after pitching each other their ideas, they settled on one and got to work
Personally I thought it was brilliant and it worked extremely well and after they left I hooked it up to my lawn sprinkler system
So they go off for a few minutes once a week now and so after a few days of being bombarded by photons from space
We finally had the battery all charged up to full capacity
So in the end I learned a lot and we actually pulled it off
And now if you'll excuse me, I have an urgent delivery deadline to meet in Colorado
i like lemonade
Okay, you like it Eliza? Okay
You're up.
People have these Nerf Dart wars at work sometimes,
so in an effort to keep people from picking on me,
I decided to create the world's largest functional Nerf gun.
So, I reached out to a couple of fellow engineering nerds, Ryan and David, from the Youtube channel
Eclectical Engineering to see if they're up for the challenge.
So, it's one thing to look good, but let's see how she holds
up against the guns of my co-workers.
So here's how it works.
So the source of the air is this 3,000 psi paintball tank.
By pushing the trigger forward, you let the air into this firing chamber here.
And then, when you're ready, you can pull it back to let the
air out into the main cylinder and fire a dart.
So, the paintball tank starts at 3,000 psi, but the silver chamber is regulated to only
80 psi for shots. By doing it this way, you get about 20 shots out of a single tape.
So, after you shoot, you just rotate the cylinder over, and you can do it 5 more times.
The darts exit the gun at about 40 miles per hour.
And they're made of pool noodles with toilet plungers on the end,
which means they can actually stick to things.
So, you can use it for skeet shooting,
or Dude Perfecting.
We also 3D printed a projectile that was a little more aerodynamic.
And we were amazed to see it travel 130 yards.
Wow..
So, I wanted to see if this thing actually worked in real life.
And as usual, my niece and nephews were picking on me.
So I challenged them to a Nerf dart war.
Only, I may have neglected to tell them about my creation.
So, a huge thanks to the brains and muscles of Ryan and David for helping to push this project
to completion. They actually made a video on their channel of everything you need to know
to build one of these for yourself. We also made some
modifications to the Nerf gun to make it possible to
absolutely obliterate watermelons. So, go watch that,
and subscribe to their channel, because they're
kind of new, but they got some really cool videos in the works.
I also want to say thanks to Audible.
So a couple times a week, I will sit right here in my backyard,
and sort of just look at the sky, and think about whatever.
And it always makes me smile when I think that one
of the dots 50 million miles away, has stuff on it that I have touched and designed.
In fact, of all the videos that I have made, my favorite one is the one
where I talk about what it felt like to see Curiosity land.
[Inaudible]
So, Rob Manning was the chief engineer for the Curiosity
Mission, and he wrote a fascinating book that I just
finished listening to, that gives a perfect overview of how
Curiosity succeeded against crazy odds. He's a really smart
dude and a great storyteller. So, if you want to learn how NASA puts robots on
tiny dots in the sky by listening to Rob's book, or if you want to
listen to any other book for free, all you have to do is use

Thanks for watching.
Neighbor: Are you guys okay?
Yeah
When the super soaker was first invented, it was an absolute game changer in my neighborhood.
So now that I'm a dad and I know how to engineer
I decided to once again level up my water fighting capabilities with this.
The Guinness World record holding
Largest water gun ever at 7 feet long. As a follow-up, of course, to my world record largest nerf gun
But, she doesn't just look good.
So I'm going to show you how we made it, how she stacks up against the original Super Soaker
and then we'll talk about the science behind how it works
But first let's just take a moment to appreciate the destructive power of a stream of water traveling at 272 miles per hour
Watermelons are great
But I wanted to see how she would fare in a real water fight in addition to running some further tests but before we get into those
Let's talk about how we made it and how it works
Together with my buddy Bob and his glorious beard we created a skeleton for the gun in fact
I won't show it here
but if you want all the gory details
On how to construct a large scale replica like this he uploaded a full video on his awesome YouTube Channel called I Like To Make Stuff
I'll put a link in the video description
and in the end after some EVA foam and a paint job
We ended up here
Let's take a look under the hood to see the design
I arrived at with my buddy Ken the first thing
The first thing you should notice is that most of the mass is down here in the handle not up here
That's because having a low center of mass is really helpful for stability and maneuverability
For something really large like this
All the components you see here are just a fancier version of all the components that make up this gun
It operates on the exact same principles, so let's start by talking about how this one works
And to do that I figured
We might as well ask the actual original inventor of the Super Soaker one of my personal
engineering heroes, Lonnie Johnson
of course one of my first questions to him was how he even came up with this idea
I got the idea In 1982. I was at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory working on the Galileo Project at the time
In fact, i was doing experiments in my home, in the bathroom, in the evening time
I wanted to develop a heat pump that would use
water as opposed to Freon. I had made these nozzles i had hooked up to the sink and
as i shot the stream of water across the bathroom
And I saw how powerful it was and how satisfying it was
I felt some high pressure in a high performance water gun and it was really really cool
As I talked more with Lonnie he showed me the very first prototype
He ever built of the gun. We talked about some of the clever design elements. For example this tank here that holds the water
Doubles as the pressure container so each time you pump you are forcing more and more air into this spot
Which makes it more and more crowded with air molecules which increases the pressure and when you pull the trigger
The air is pushing down on the water
So hard the only place it can go is through this tube and out the gun and so this is why this tube is
intentionally bent down like this
because no matter which way you tilt the gun it's always going to be below the water line and therefore water will come out and
Not air and so now in our case instead of pumping we fill this tank up with
High-pressure nitrogen gas and then this tank is filled with about two gallons of water and just like the Super Soaker it has a tube
that runs all the way down and is open at the bottom so then this gas is at a
Really high pressure and it wants to get out so when you pull the trigger
And open the flow it pushes down on the top of the water which forces it up this tube and out at
272 miles per hour and the Trigger is just this ball valve joint here
but I thought it would be lame if every time you wanted to fire you had to turn some the handle so we have a
Pneumatic piston here, that's also powered by the nitrogen
And then we have a solenoid that's connected to some double-A batteries back there for power and so when you push this button it opens
the ball valve and allows water to flow through
Until I release the button. I'll put a link to the CAD files we made along with a build list of all the components
we used in the video description if you want to make something similar
Oh, one final cool feature is we have this cover here
That's held on with rare-earth magnets, so after you've shot a bunch and need to refill the water and the gas
You can just easily access the fill valves through this window here and now back to the gratuitous violence
It's a double rainbow all the way
For some context on the power of this gun the original Super Soaker was pressurized to 40 PSI
And the pressure from the hose of your house is just a little more than around 50 PSI, a firetruck hose
comes in at around six times that at 300 PSI and this beast is eight times the pressure of a firetruck at
2400 PSI which in hindsight is probably overkill
One final really cool feature of the gun is you can swap out the nozzle depending on what you're shooting
So this nozzle has a really small diameter opening which leads to a high stream velocity, but lower overall water output
So it's good for cutting or puncturing stuff then this nozzle is basically wide open at a quarter-inch so it's a little lower
Velocity but it's the maximum water output, so it's good for getting things drenched fast or breaking things with Force
So now with the gun fully tested
I wanted to see how we would do in an actual water fight, so we got together for a party with some family friends
But to make things fair we took turns picking guns, but of course I got first pick
So it worked awesome, and I completely destroyed them
until I ran out of water
It took us about six months to build this Super Soaker and it wouldn't have been possible without the support of the awesome folks at
23andme I just got my results back, and I will share them with you in just a second if you've never heard of them
They send you this box and then you spit in this Tube and then you put it back in the mail
And then they analyze the DNA in your chromosomes hence the name 23andme because humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes
And then they tell you all sorts of really interesting stuff about you, so for example in my case. I learned I am
45% from Britain and Ireland and amazingly, I'm 3% Jewish. Shalom. I also learned
I am more neanderthal than 96% of all 23andme customers
They also predict some of your physical traits based on your DNA which was astonishingly accurate except this one was a little suspect
Anyways, I thought it was so cool
I got them as gifts for everyone in my family
So if you want to learn more about what 23andme does or even better if you want to learn what your DNA says about you
Or your friends and family you can use the link in the description or go to 23andme.com/MarkRober. Thanks for watching
